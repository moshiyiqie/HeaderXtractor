This system is used to redesign the well-known NASA P2 and P8 hypersonic inlets. First, the Navier-Stokes simulations of the original P2 and P8 inlet designs are validated using numerical convergence studies and comparison with wind-tunnel experimental data for the original inlets published by NASA in the early 1970s. Second, the P2 and P8 inlets are redesigned with the objective of canceling the cowl shock (and, in the case of the P8 inlet, the additional cowl-generated compression) at the centerbody by appropriate contouring of the centerbody boundary. The original inlets were intended to achieve these same objectives, but detailed experimental measurements indicated that a substantial reflected shock system was present. The choice of the objective function, which is used to drive the optimization, has a significant impact on the final design. Several different formulations for the objective function have been employed, and improvements of 60% to 90% in the objective function have been achieved. This automated design system represents one of the first successful combinations of numerical optimization methods with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics simulation for high speed inlets, and demonstrates a new area in which High Performance Computing may have considerable impact on problems of military and industrial significance.  </abstract>::line_number::6",657,false

In particular, we consider the propositional rule generation algorithm of the Discovery Board system, and present our design and implementation of a parallel algorithm for the same task. We then present some early performance results of our parallelization scheme on hardware and software distributed shared memory multiprocessors.  </abstract>::line_number::5",659,false

Depending on the problem solving task at hand, different models will be appropriate. Several investigators have recently developed methods of automatically selecting among multiple models of physical systems. Our research is novel in that we are developing model selection techniques specifically suited to computer-aided de sign. Our approach is based on the idea that artifact performance models for computer-aided design should be chosen in light of the design decisions they are required to support. We have developed a technique called Gradient Magnitude Model Selection (GMMS), which embodies this principle. GMMS operates in the context of a hillclimbing search process. It selects the simplest model that meets the needs of the hillclimbing algorithm in which it operates. We are using the domain of sailing yacht design as a testbed for this research. We have implemented GMMS and used it in hillclimb-ing search to decide between a computationally expensive potential-flow program and an algebraic approximation to analyze the performance of sailing yachts. Experimental tests show that GMMS makes the design process faster than it would be if the most expensive model were used for all design evaluations. GMMS achieves this performance improvement with little or no sacrifice in the quality of the resulting design.  </abstract>::line_number::5",660,false

But the great promise of architectural models has not been fulfilled so far, due to a gap between the model and the system it purports to describe. It is our contention that this gap is best bridged if the model is not just stated, but is enforced. This gives rise to a concept enforced architectural model |or, a law | which is explored in this paper. We argue that this model has two major beneficial consequences: First, by bridging the above mentioned gap between an architectural model and the actual system, an enforced architectural model provides a truly reliable framework within which a system can be reasoned about and maintained. Second, our model provides software developers with a carefully circumscribed flexibility in molding the law of a project, during its evolutionary lifetime|while maintaining certain architectural principles as invariant of evolution.  </abstract>::line_number::6",661,false

Principles like this are routinely adopted in real-life projects, however neither the programming languages nor the existing environments provide enough support for effective realization of these principles. It is our thesis that broad structural principles should be formally specified, strictly enforced, and relaxed whenever relaxation is in order. In this paper we show how this can be done under our darwin-E environment using, the Law of Demeter as an illustration.  </abstract>::line_number::8",662,false

The program incorporates novel approaches to experience generation and representation generation. The experience generator uses a heuristic based on Shannon's uncertainty function to find informative examples. The representation generator makes conjectures on the basis of small amounts of evidence and retracts them if they prove to be wrong or useless. A number of experiments are described which demonstrate that the system can distribute its learning resources to steadily acquire a good representation of the whole of a domain, and that the system can readily acquire both disjunctive and conjunctive concepts even in the presence of noise.  </abstract>::line_number::4",663,false

Multiple shooting is one of the most widely used numerical techniques for solving BVODE problems. In this work, we present a new distributed parallel numerical algorithm for BVODEs which is based on multiple shooting. We investigate the numerical stability of this new distributed algorithm and identify difficulties that can arise. We propose a new parallel iterative refinement scheme to cope with some specific numerical difficulties identified in our investigation. Computational experience is presented to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of our approach.  </abstract>::line_number::4",664,false

The idea is to observe training examples one-at-a-time and decide on-line when to return a hypothesis, rather than collect a large fixed-size training sample. This yields sequential learning procedures that pac-learn by observing a small random number of examples. We provide theoretical bounds on the expected training sample size of our procedure | but establish its efficiency primarily by a series of experiments which show sequential learning actually uses many times fewer training examples in practice. These results demonstrate that pac-learning can be far more efficiently achieved in practice than previously thought.  </abstract>::line_number::10",665,false

I propose a simple unit that adds zero-mean Gaussian noise to its input before passing it through a sigmoidal squashing function. Such units can produce a variety of useful behaviors, ranging from deterministic to binary stochastic to continuous stochastic. I show how slice sampling (Neal 1996) can be used for inference and learning in top-down networks of these units and demonstrate learning on two simple problems.  </abstract>::line_number::4",666,false

This suggests that it may be more efficient to answer queries using a Horn approximation; i.e., a horn theory that is semantically similar to the original theory. The utility of any such approximation depends on how often it produces answers to the queries that the system actually encounters; we therefore seek an approximation whose expected coverage is maximal. Unfortunately, there are several obstacles to achieving this goal in practice: (i) The optimal approximation depends on the query distribution, which is typically not known a priori; (ii) identifying the optimal approximation is intractable, even given the query distribution; and (iii) the optimal approximation might be too large to guarantee tractable inference. This paper presents an approach that overcomes (or side-steps) each of these obstacles. We define a learning process, AdComp, that uses observed queries to estimate the query distribution online, and then uses these estimates to hill-climb, efficiently, in the space of size-bounded Horn approximations, until reaching one that is, with provably high probability, effectively at a local optimum.  </abstract>::line_number::10",667,false

Given an initial estimate of its position (perhaps based on dead-reckoning) and an image taken of a known environment, our agent first attempts to locate a set of landmarks (real-world objects at known locations), then uses their angular separation to obtain an improved estimate of its current position. Unfortunately, some landmarks may not be visible, or worse, may be confused with other landmarks, resulting in both time wasted in searching for invisible landmarks, and in further errors in the agent's estimate of its position. To address these problems, we propose a method that uses previous experiences to learn a selection function that, given the set of landmarks that might be visible, returns the subset which can reliably be found correctly, and so provide an accurate registration of the agent's position. We use statistical techniques to prove that the learned selection function is, with high probability, effectively at a local optimal in the space of such functions. This report also presents empirical evidence, using real-world data, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.  </abstract>::line_number::9",670,false

In many concurrent programming languages, concurrent programs are difficult to extend and modify: small changes in a concurrent program may require re-implementations of a large number of its components. In this paper a novel concurrent program composition mechanism is presented in which implementations of computations and synchronizations are completely separated. Separation of implementations facilitates extensions and modifications of programs by allowing one to change implementations of both computations and synchronizations. The paper also describes a concurrent programming model and a programming lan guage that support the proposed approach.  </abstract>::line_number::6",671,false

We propose a method for solving a model of age-dependent population diusion with random dispersal. This method, unlike previous methods, allows for variable time steps and independent age and time discretizations. We use a moving age discretization that transforms the problem to a system of parabolic equations. The system is then solved by backward dierences in time and a Galerkin approximation in space; the equations that need to be solved at each step treat each age group separately. A priori L 2 error estimates are obtained by an energy analysis. These estimates are superconvergent in the age variable. We present a postprocessing technique which capitalizes on the superconvergence.  </abstract>::line_number::2",672,false

A new wave of data-intensive and knowledge-based applications|such as data mining and decision support|require the introduction of complex application-specific aggregate functions. In this paper, we propose extensions for deductive database systems to support these new applications. We develop constructs, formal semantics, and implementation techniques for user-defined aggregates, and describe their realization in an extended LDL++ system recently built at UCLA. With these extensions, the system can support online aggregation, roll-ups for data cubing, temporal aggregates for time-series, iceberg queries, and other recently proposed operators used in decision support and data mining procedures. We then discuss the application of this technology to other DBMSs, and in particular to the SQL3 specifications that support the notion of user-defined aggregates. We show that SQL3 suffers from limitations that severely restrict its use in new applications; thus we propose simple extensions similar to those used for LDL++ to overcome such limitations.  </abstract>::line_number::5",674,false

However, expressing these algorithms within the declarative framework of logic-based languages has proved to be a difficult research challenge. In this paper, we extend the framework of Datalog-like languages to obtain simple declarative formulations for such problems, and propose effective implementation techniques to ensure computational complexities comparable to those of procedural formulations. These advances are achieved through the use of the choice construct, that has semantics reducible to that of programs with negation under stable model semantics. Then we extend the fixpoint-based semantics of choice programs with preference annotations to guide search strategies and simple logic-based formulations of classical greedy algorithms.  </abstract>::line_number::5",675,false

A common technique to support recovery is asynchronous checkpointing, coupled with optimistic message logging. These schemes have low overheads during failure-free operations and can provide an acceptable degree of fault-tolerance. Central to these protocols is the determination of a maximal consistent global state, which is recoverable. Message semantics is not exploited in most existing recovery protocols to determine the recoverable state. We propose to identify messages that are not influential in the computation through message semantics. These messages can be logically removed from the computation without changing its meaning or result. In this paper, we illustrate with examples how the removal of these messages improves the theoretical maximal consistent global state. Taking semantics into account, recovery protocols are then developed to realize the idea. The semantics in object-oriented databases is adapted to special processes acting as servers for further improvements. This technique can also be applied to ensure a more timely commitment for output in a distributed computation.  </abstract>::line_number::4",676,false

However, it is still an open problem to efficiently parallelize sparse matrix factorizations commonly used in iterative numerical problems. The difficulty is that a factorization process contains irregularly-interleaved communication and computation with varying granularities and it is hard to obtain scalable performance on distributed memory machines. In this paper, we present an inspector/executor approach for parallelizing such applications by embodying automatic graph scheduling techniques to optimize interleaved communication and computation. We describe a run-time system called RAPID that provides a set of library functions for specifying irregular data objects and tasks that access these objects. The system extracts a task dependence graph from data access patterns, and executes tasks efficiently on a distributed memory machine. We discuss a set of optimization strategies used in this system and demonstrate the application of this system in parallelizing sparse Cholesky and LU factorizations.  </abstract>::line_number::5",677,false

The proposed approach is based on a simple concept of basis expansion. It is widely applicable to many popular basis representations, such as wavelets [4, 5, 24, 25], short-time Fourier analysis [15, 30], and splines [2, 6, 33]. Exploiting formulations that use both global and local information about shape and color, the new approach is neither strictly global nor local. It has the advantage of tolerating a certain degree of occlusion (unlike global analysis) and does not require estimating high-order derivatives in computing invariants (unlike local analysis), whence is more robust. Furthermore, it enables a quasi-localized, hierarchical shape analysis which is not possible with other known invariant techniques. Unlike most current research on image invariants which concentrates on either geometry or illumination invariants, the proposed framework is very general and produces invariants which are insensitive to rigid motion, general affine transform, changes of parameterization and scene illumination, and perspective transform.  </abstract>::line_number::7",678,false

Two operations commute if the result of their execution is independent of the order in which they execute. Commuting operations can be executed concurrently provided they execute atomically on the objects they access. Statically recognizing commuting operations is of great interest because they increase the amount of concurrency a compiler can exploit. In this document we introduce commutativity analysis anew technique for automatically parallelizing serial programs. We then conduct a feasibility study of existing scientific applications as to the existence and exploitability of commuting operations. We study the commuting operations present in one such application the Barnes-Hut hierarchical N-body algorithm. We then parallelize this application using knowledge of commuting operations and present performance results of the parallel code for a shared-memory multiprocessor.  </abstract>::line_number::4",681,false

The design and implementation presented here is the application of a more general Concurrency Model we have built to introduce concurrency to sequential OOPLs. The model views concurrency as a well-defined, inheritable property of objects specified in the class CONCURRENCY, and provides a methodology using inheritance to write concurrent object-orient applications. Key ideas involved in the methodology are: active objects, extensibility of protocols, synchronization programming, data-driven synchronization with asynchronous message passing. The novel feature of our work is in its describing concurrency in the context of sequential programming and using a object-oriented design methodology to describe and implement it. We illustrate the usefulness and expressiveness of the concurrency mechanism by presenting examples and analyzing them. The ability to express powerful synchronization constraints as reusable software components emerges as a strong point of our implementation.  </abstract>::line_number::5",682,false

The Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) is a recent communication standard for cluster interconnects. We focus on non-coherent SCI, using our cluster setup of SBus-based and PCI-based workstations connected via Dolphin SCI adapters. Our motivation for choosing SCI as network fabric is the very low latency and high bandwidth. We study how to map a variety of programming models efficiently onto the SCI hardware, focusing on message passing and global address space support, implementing Active Messages and Split-C. We present implementation trade-offs, present performance measurements and compare the PCI and SBus adapters. We found that the user-level load/store programming interface of SCI is very convenient to use, achieves low latencies, and is fully virtualized, simultaneously supporting multiple parallel programs and communication channels. On the other hand, neither of the programming models studied maps directly to SCI. Issues such as notification, atomic operations, and virtual address space limitations represent major implementation challenges, which we address with a combination of compiler and run-time support. Overall, we found the SCI network a good substrate for high-performance cluster computing.  </abstract>::line_number::6",683,false

However solving irregular problems with mixed granularities such as sparse matrix factorization is challenging since it requires efficient run-time support to execute a DAG schedule. In this paper, we investigate run-time optimization techniques for executing general asynchronous DAG schedules on distributed memory machines. Our solution tightly integrates the run-time scheme with a fast communication mechanism to eliminate unnecessary overhead in message buffering and copying. We discuss a consistency model incorporating the above optimizations, and taking advantage of task dependence properties to ensure the correctness of execution. We demonstrate the applications of this scheme in sparse factorizations and triangular solver for which actual speedups are hard to obtain. Our experiments on Meiko CS-2 show that the automatically scheduled code has achieved scalable performance for these problems and the run-time overhead is small compared to the total execution time.  </abstract>::line_number::5",684,false

Many interesting search problems not known to be solvable in polynomial time are contained in these classes, and a number of them are complete problems. We consider the question of the relative complexity of these search problem classes. We prove several separations which show that in a generic relativized world, the search classes are distinct and there is a standard search problem in each of them that is not computation-ally equivalent to any decision problem. (Naturally, absolute separations would imply that P 6= NP.) Our separation proofs have interesting combinatorial content and go to the heart of the combinatorial principles on which the classes are based. We derive one result via new lower bounds on the degrees of polynomials asserted to exist by Hilbert's Null-stellensatz over finite fields.  </abstract>::line_number::18",688,false

However, the performance of parallel applications on such systems is highly dependent on the mapping of application tasks to machines. In this paper, we propose a mapping strategy for applications formed by multiple tasks targeted to heterogeneous platforms. We first define a mapping model, the match-tree, which reects the data movement and conversion costs of distributed algorithms and allows for alternative implementations of individual tasks on different machines. We then define the find-mapping and split-partition algorithms, based on the match-tree model, to determine the best allocation of tasks to resources in heterogeneous systems. We illustrate the use of these algorithms with a sample distributed application.  </abstract>::line_number::5",689,false

In the present paper, this result is used to show that almost all r-regular graphs are hamiltonian for any fixed r 3, by an analysis of the distribution of 1-factors in random regular graphs. Moreover, almost all such graphs are r-edge-colourable if they have an even number of vertices. Similarly, almost all r-regular bipartite graphs are hamiltonian and r-edge-colourable for fixed r 3.  </abstract>::line_number::7",690,false

To realize potential execution efficiency, it is now customary for an optimizing compiler to employ a heuristic algorithm for instruction scheduling. These algorithms are painstakingly hand-crafted, which is expenseive and time-consuming. We show how to cast the instruction scheduling problem as a learning task, so that one obtains the heuristic scheduling algorithm automatically. Our focus is the narrower problem of scheduling straight-line code, also known as a basic block of instructions. Our empirical results show that just a few features are adequate for quite good performance at this task for a real modern processor, and that any of several supervised learning methods perform nearly optimally with respect to the features used.  </abstract>::line_number::22",691,false

In this paper we summarize an approach to this problem based on the mathematical framework of Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning. Current model-based reinforcement learning is based on one-step models that cannot represent common-sense higher-level actions, such as going to lunch, grasping an object, or flying to Denver. This paper generalizes prior work on temporally abstract models [Sutton, 1995] and extends it from the prediction setting to include actions, control, and planning. We introduce a more general form of temporally abstract model, the multi-time model, and establish its suitability for planning and learning by virtue of its relationship to the Bellman equations. This paper summarizes the theoretical framework of multi-time models and illustrates their potential advantages in a gridworld planning task.  </abstract>::line_number::5",692,false

Value functions over options and models of options can be learned using methods designed for semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs). However, all these methods require an option to be executed to termination. In this paper we explore methods that learn about an option from small fragments of experience consistent with that option, even if the option itself is not executed. We call these methods intra-option learning methods because they learn from experience within an option. Intra-option methods are sometimes much more efficient than SMDP methods because they can use off-policy temporal-difference mechanisms to learn simultaneously about all the options consistent with an experience, not just the few that were actually executed. In this paper we present intra-option learning methods for learning value functions over options and for learning multi-time models of the consequences of options.

In addition to the basic need of authentication, confidentiality and key distribution services, a new problem involving privacy is the unauthorized tracking of users' migration. In other words, accessing any information related to the mobile user's location data without his consent, is a serious violation of his privacy. Moreover, if no care is taken, the disclosure of the mobile user real identity may appear during the authentication process. The basic solution to this problem is the use of aliases which insure non-traceability by hiding the user's real identity and also his relationship with domain authorities. In this paper we provide a classification of the different degrees of non-traceability and present a new efficient method for the computation of aliases. This technique can be used during authentication of mobile users and thus avoids the drawbacks of existing solutions such as GSM and CDPD.  </abstract>::line_number::5",694,false

Specifically, the method uses multiple type-specific data encodings to represent system states, and it carries out fixpoint computations via the corresponding type-specific symbolic operations. In essence, different symbolic encodings are unified into one composite model checker. Any type-specific language can be included in this framework provided that the language is closed under Boolean connectives, propositions can be checked for satisfiability, and relational images can be computed. Our technique relies on conjunctive partitioning of transition relations of atomic events based on variable types involved, which allows independent computation of one-step pre- and post-conditions for each variable type. In this paper we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a nontrivial data-transfer protocol, which contains a mixture of integer and Boolean-valued variables. The protocol operates over an unreliable channel that can lose, duplicate or reorder messages. Moreover, the protocol's send and receive window sizes are not specified in advance; rather, they are represented as symbolic constants. The resulting system was automatically verified using our composite model checking approach, in concert with a conservative approximation technique.  </abstract>::line_number::4",695,false

At the same time, the traditional TCP with its congestion control is well known for its poor performance over wireless links. This paper proposes a new protocol that (1) replaces TCP/IP over the wireless link by a simpler protocol with smaller headers, if the link is the last hop along a data path, (2) shifts functions needed to communicate with an Internet host using TCP/IP from the mobile host to the base station, so that the distinct wireless link is hidden from the outside Internet, and (3) exploits link-layer acknowledgments and re-transmissions to quickly recover losses over the wireless link. Our simulation results show a substantial performance improvement achieved by the new protocol.  </abstract>::line_number::9",696,false

We propose a new paradigm, namely, Ratio Rules, which are quantifiable in that we can measure the goodness of a set of discovered rules. We propose to use the guessing error as a measure of the goodness, that is, the root-mean-square error of the reconstructed values of the cells of the given matrix, when we pretend that they are unknown. Another contribution is a novel method to guess missing/hidden values from the Ratio Rules that our method derives. For example, if somebody bought $10 of milk and $3 of bread, our rules can guess the amount spent on, say, butter. Thus, we can perform a variety of important tasks such as forecasting, answering what-if scenarios, detecting outliers, and visualizing the data. Moreover, we show how to compute Ratio Rules in a single pass over the dataset with small memory requirements (a few small matrices), in contrast to traditional association rule mining methods that require multiple passes and/or large memory.

Abstraction is used to remove detail from the state representation, reducing both the size of the state space that must be explored to produce a plan and the size of the resulting plan. The intuition behind this approach is simple: in some situations, certain world features are important, while in other situations those same features are not important. By automatically selecting the appropriate level of abstraction at each step during the planning process, DAP can significantly reduce the size of the search space. Furthermore, the planning process can supply initial plans that preserve safety but might, on further refinement, do a better job of goal achievement. DAP can also terminate with an executable abstract plan, which may be much smaller than the corresponding plan expanded to precisely-defined states. Preliminary results show dramatic improvements in planning speed and scalability.  </abstract>::line_number::6",698,false

In this overview, we sketch an account of the developments in this scientifically intriguing field, starting in the early 80's when the first questions about the computability of quantum processes were raised, and which led to the formal definitions of a Quantum Computer and a Quantum Complexity Theory. Peter Shor's recent remarkable discovery of quantum algorithms to solve the problems of integer factoring and discrete log computing, which are believed to be extremely hard to solve efficiently on classical computers, is a compelling demonstration of the suspected superiority of quantum computing over the classical model that is in use today. We discuss one of his algorithms and the implications it has for classical cryptography. We discuss some of the latest work in this field which has brought us yet closer to achieving a physical realization of a quantum computer. Whenever it happens, if it happens, it would be yet another revolution in the field of computing, and maybe the biggest one to date.  </abstract>::line_number::3",700,false

For many problems, however, there is no single exact solution. Rather, there is a range of acceptable answers. We use cases not only as a basis for a solution, but also to indicate the boundaries within which a solution can be found. We solve problems by choosing some point within those boundaries. In this paper, I discuss this use of cases with illustrations from chiron, a system I have implemented in the domain of personal income tax planning.  </abstract>::line_number::5",701,false

The reason for this is the need for effective and efficient techniques, that meet user requirements, to access large volumes of digital images and video data. In [GR 95], previous approaches to content-based retrieval is said to have taken two directions. In the first approach, image contents are modeled as a set of attributes extracted manually and managed within the framework of conventional database-management systems. The second approach depends on an integrated feature-extraction/object-recognition subsystem to overcome the limitations of attribute-based retrieval. However, it has been also stated that [GR 95] recent content-based image retrieval systems recognized the need for synergy between these two approaches. There has been numerous efforts to build content-based image retrieval systems. These include, Chabot [OS 95], SCORE [ATY 95, ATY 96], CONIVAS [AD 96], Photobook [PPS 93], CANDID [KCH 95], JACOB [ALDV 96, LA 96], VisualSEEk [SC 96] and QBIC [FSN+ 95]. In the first place, these systems differ in their querying capabilities. Images could be retrieved through the use of color, texture, sketch, shape, volume, spatial constraints, browsing, motion, text and domain concepts. Current approaches to content-based image retrieval also differ in terms of image features extracted, their level of abstraction and the degree of domain independence. In this paper, a comparative survey on these systems is conducted to figure out design tradeoffs and different approaches to content-based image retrieval. Furthermore, a taxonomy of content-based retrieval systems, as well as a generic architecture, is provided.  </abstract>::line_number::3",702,false

While compression can be used to decrease the size of the dataset, compressed data is notoriously difficult to index or access. In this paper we consider a very large dataset comprising multiple distinct time sequences. Each point in the sequence is a numerical value. We show how to compress such a dataset into a format that supports ad hoc querying, provided that a small error can be tolerated when the data is uncompressed. Experiments on large, real world datasets (AT&T customer calling patterns) show that the proposed method achieves an average of less than 5% error in any data value after compressing to a mere 2.5% of the original space (i.e., a 40:1 compression ratio), with these numbers not very sensitive to dataset size. Experiments on aggregate queries achieved a 0.5% reconstruction error with a space requirement under 2%.  </abstract>::line_number::13",703,false

The speed and efficacy of these steps has a major influence on the lead time of the product from conceptualization to launching. In this paper we propose a methodology for automatically generating redesign suggestions for reducing setup costs for machined parts. Given an interpretation of the design as a collection of machinable features, our approach is to generate alternate machining features by making geometric changes to the original features, and add them to the feature set of the original part to create an extended feature set. The designer may provide restrictions on the design indicating the type and extent of modifications allowed on certain faces and volumes, in which case all redesign suggestions generated by our approach honor those restrictions. By taking combinations of features from the extended feature set generated above, we can generate modified versions of the original design that still satisfy the designer's intent. By considering precedence constraints and approach directions for the machining operations as well as simple fixturability constraints, we can estimate the setup time that will be required for each design. Any modified design whose setup time is less than that of the original design can be presented to the designer as a possible way to modify the original design.  </abstract>::line_number::14",705,false

It is a best effort protocol that attempts to ameliorate the effect of jitter, load variation, and packet loss, to provide low latency, synchronized audio and video communications. This goal is realized through four transport and display mechanisms, and a real-time implementation of these mechanisms that integrates operating system services ( e.g., scheduling and resource allocation, and device management) with network communication services ( e.g., transport protocols), and with application code ( e.g., display routines). The four mechanisms are: a facility for varying the synchronization between audio and video to achieve continuous audio in the face of jitter, a network congestion monitoring mechanism that is used to control audio/video latency, a queueing mechanism at the sender that is used to maximize frame throughput without unnecessarily increasing latency, and a forward error correction mechanism for transmitting audio frames multiple times to ameliorate the effects of packet loss in the network. The effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated by measuring the performance of the protocol when transmitting audio and video across congested networks.  </abstract>::line_number::6",706,false

In this paper, we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a high speed network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most effectively toward reducing the variability of the transmitted bit rate. We present two basic results. First, we present an optimal smoothing algorithm for achieving the greatest possible reduction in rate variability when transmitting stored video to a client with given buffer size. We provide a formal proof of optimality, and demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on a set of long MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for video transport, under two network service models: Deterministic Guar- anteed service [1, 11] and Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service [9, 8]. Under both models, we find the impact of optimal smoothing to be dramatic.  </abstract>::line_number::5",707,false

However, conventional CORBA Object Request Brokers (ORBs) exhibit substantial priority inversion and non-determinism, which makes them unsuitable for applications with deterministic real-time requirements. This paper focuses on software architectures that help to alleviate priority inversion and non-determinism in real-time CORBA ORBs. It also illustrates empirically why conventional ORBs do not yet support real-time quality of service.  </abstract>::line_number::6",708,false

The algorithms analyze per-process shared data accesses, pinpoint the data structures that are susceptible to false sharing and choose an appropriate transformation to reduce it. The transformations either group data that is accessed by the same processor or separate individual data items that are shared. This paper evaluates that technique. We show through simulation that our analysis successfully identifies the data structures that are responsible for most false sharing misses, and then transforms them without unduly decreasing spatial locality. The reduction in false sharing positively impacts both execution time and program scalability when executed on a KSR2. Both factors combine to increase the maximum achievable speedup for all programs, more than doubling it for several. Despite being able to only approximate actual inter-processor memory accesses, the compiler-directed transformations always outperform programmer efforts to eliminate false sharing.  </abstract>::line_number::9",709,false

The purpose of the analysis is to aid in the disambiguation of heap-allocated data structures by estimating the shape (Tree, DAG, or Cyclic Graph) of the data structure accessible from each heap-directed pointer. This shape information can be used to improve dependence testing and in parallelization, and to guide the choice of more complex heap analyses. The method has been implemented as a context-sensitive interprocedural analysis in the McCAT compiler. Experimental results and observations are given for 16 benchmark programs. These results show that the analysis gives accurate and useful results for an important group of applications.  </abstract>::line_number::6",710,false

A major feature which distinguishes high speed networks from traditional slower speed networks is the large amount of data the network must manage. For efficient network usage, traffic control mechanisms are essential. Currently, most mechanisms for traffic control (such as flow control) have centered on the support of Available Bit Rate (ABR), i.e., non real-time, traffic. With regard to ATM, for ABR traffic, two major types of schemes which have been proposed are rate-control and credit-control schemes. Neither of these schemes are directly applicable to Real-time Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic such as continuous media traffic. Traffic control for continuous media traffic is an inherently difficult problem due to the time-sensitive nature of the traffic and its unpredictable burstiness. In this study, we present a scheme which controls traffic by dynamically allocating/de-allocating resources among competing VCs based upon their real-time requirements. This scheme incorporates a form of rate-control, real-time burst-level scheduling and link-link flow control. We show analytically potential performance improvements of our rate-control scheme and present a scheme for buffer dimensioning. We also present simulation results of our schemes and discuss the tradeoffs inherent in maintaining high network utilization and statistically guaranteeing many users' Quality of Service.  </abstract>::line_number::4",714,false

The multilevel k-way partitioning algorithm reduces the size of the graph by collapsing vertices and edges (coarsening phase), finds a k-way partitioning of the smaller graph, and then it constructs a k-way partitioning for the original graph by projecting and refining the partition to successively finer graphs (uncoarsening phase). A key innovative feature of our parallel formulation is that it utilizes graph coloring to effectively parallelize both the coarsening and the refinement during the uncoarsening phase. Our algorithm is able to achieve a high degree of concurrency, while maintaining the high quality partitions produced by the serial algorithm. We test our scheme on a large number of graphs from finite element methods, and transportation domains. For graphs with a million vertices, our parallel formulation produces high quality 128-way partitions on 128 processors in a little over two seconds, on Cray T3D. Thus our parallel algorithm makes it feasible to perform frequent dynamic graph partition in adaptive computations without compromising quality.  </abstract>::line_number::9",715,false

In this paper our aim is to determine a plan that makes the execution of an individual query very fast, making minimizing parallel execution time the right objective. This creates the following circular dependence: a plan tree is needed for effective resource assignment, which is needed to estimate the parallel execution time, and this is needed for the cost-based search for a good plan tree. In this paper we propose a new search heuristic that breaks the cycle by constructing the plan tree layer by layer in a bottom-up manner. To select nodes at the next level, the lower and upper bounds on the execution time for plans consistent with the decisions made so far are estimated and are used to guide the search. A query plan representation for intra- and inter-operator parallelism, pipelining, and processor and memory assignment is proposed. Also proposed is a new approach to estimating the parallel execution time of a plan that considers sum and max of operators working sequentially and in parallel, respectively. The results obtained from a prototype optimizer are presented.  </abstract>::line_number::4",716,false

However, we believe that we need to take this support a step further. A more modular, or object oriented approach is needed if we wish to cross the barrier of complexity that is holding back distributed operating system development. The Chorus Ob ject Oriented Layer (COOL) is a layer built above the Chorus micro-kernel designed to extend the micro-kernel abstractions with support for object oriented systems. COOL v2, the second iteration of this layer provides generic support for clusters of objects, in a distributed virtual memory model. It is built as a layered system where the lowest layer support only clusters and the upper layers support objects.  </abstract>::line_number::4",717,false

There are two key objectives of our work. The first is to enable functionality for object sharing in lock-free real-time systems that is comparable to that in lock-based systems. Our main contribution toward this objective is an efficient approach for implementing multi-object lock-free operations and transactions. A second key objective of our work is to improve upon previously proposed scheduling conditions for tasks that share lock-free objects. When developing such conditions, the key issue is to bound the cost of operation interferences. We present a general approach for doing this, based on linear programming.  </abstract>::line_number::4",720,false

Most previous universal constructions require processes to copy the entire object state, which is impractical for large objects. Previous attempts to address this problem require programmers to explicitly fragment large objects into smaller, more manageable pieces, paying particular attention to how such pieces are copied. In contrast, our constructions are designed to largely shield programmers from this fragmentation. Furthermore, for many objects, our constructions result in lower copying overhead than previous ones. Fragmentation is achieved in our constructions through the use of load-linked, store-conditional, and validate operations on a large multi-word shared variable. Before presenting our constructions, we show that these operations can be efficiently implemented from similar one-word primitives.  </abstract>::line_number::3",721,false

ABSTRACT Hierarchical dynamic simplification (HDS) is a new approach to the problem of simplifying arbitrary polygonal environments. HDS operates dynamically, retessellating the scene continuously as the users viewing position shifts, and adaptively, processing the entire database without first decomposing the environment into individual objects. The resulting system allows real-time display of very complex polygonal CAD models consisting of thousands of parts and hundreds of thousands of polygons. HDS supports various preprocessing algorithms and various runtime criteria, providing a general framework for dynamic view-dependent simplification. Briefly, HDS works by clustering vertices together in a hierarchical fashion. The simplification process continuously queries this hierarchy to generate a scene containing only those polygons that are important from the current viewpoint. When the volume of space associated with a vertex cluster occupies less than a userspecified amount of the screen, all vertices within that cluster are collapsed together and degenerate polygons filtered out. HDS maintains an active list of visible polygons for rendering. Since frame-to-frame movements typically involve small changes in viewpoint, and therefore modify the active list by only a few polygons, the method takes advantage of temporal coherence for greater speed. CR Categories: I.3.5 [Computer Graphics]: Computational Geometry and Object Modeling - surfaces and object representations. Additional Keywords: polygonal simplification, level of detail, view dependent rendering.  </abstract>::line_number::3",722,false

A kinematic model of a human index finger is developed as an example for human hand modeling. The parameters of the model are determined by open-loop kinematic calibration. Singular value decomposition is used as a tool for analyzing the kinematic model and the identification process. Accurate and reliable results are obtained only when the numerical condition is minimized through parameter scaling, model reduction and pose set selection. The identified kinematic parameters show the kinematic model and calibration procedure have an accuracy on the order of a few millimeters.  </abstract>::line_number::4",723,false

Objects are characterized by dossiers which describe both their language defined and extra-linguistic properties. These dossiers are generated by a C++ preprocessor in concert with an augmented, but completely C++ compatible, class description language. The design places very few burdens on the application programmer and can be used without altering the data member layout of application objects or inheriting from special classes. The storage format is kept simple to allow the use of a variety of data storage backends. In addition, these dossiers can be used to implement (or augment) a run-time typing facility compatible with the proposed ANSI C++ standard. Finally, by providing a generic object to byte stream conversion the persistent object facility can also be used in conjunction with an interprocess communication facility to provide object-level communication between processes. 1  </abstract>::line_number::5",724,false

While current performance analysis tools provide insights into application dynamics and the causes of poor performance, with a posteriori analysis one cannot adapt to temporally varying application resource demands and system responses. We believe that the solution to this performance optimization conundrum is integration of dynamic performance instrumentation and on-the-fly performance data reduction with real-time adaptive control mechanisms that select and configure resource management algorithms automatically, based on observed application behavior, or interactively, through high-modality virtual environments. We motivate this belief by first describing our experiences with performance analysis tools, input/output characterization, and WWW server analysis, and then sketching the design of interactive and closed loop adaptive control systems.  </abstract>::line_number::5",725,false

This paper describes the first results from research 1 on the compilation of constraint systems into task level parallel programs in a procedural language. This is the only research, of which we are aware, which attempts to generate efficient parallel programs for numerical computations from constraint systems. Computations are expressed as constraint systems. A dependence graph is derived from the constraint system and a set of input variables. The dependence graph, which exploits the parallelism in the constraints, is mapped to the target language CODE, which represents parallel computation structures as generalized dependence graphs. Finally, parallel C programs are generated. The granularity of the derived dependence graphs depends upon the complexity of the operations represented in the type system of the constraint specification language. To extract parallel programs of appropriate granularity, the following features have been included: (i) modularity, (ii) operations over structured types as primitives, (iii) definition of sequential C functions. A prototype of the compiler has been implemented. The execution environment or software architecture is specified separately from the constraint system. The domain of matrix computations has been targeted for applications. Some examples have been programmed. Initial results are very encouraging.  </abstract>::line_number::5",726,false

Given a wire segment of length L, let f(x) be the width of the wire at position x, 0 x L. We show that the optimal wire-sizing function that minimizes the Elmore delay through the wire is f(x) = ae bx , where a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0 are constants that can be computed in O(1) time. In the case where lower bound (L &gt; 0) and upper bound (U &gt; 0) on the wire widths are given, we show that the optimal wire-sizing function f(x) is a truncated version of ae bx that can also be determined in O(1) time. Our wire-sizing formula can be iteratively applied to optimally size the wire segments in a routing tree.  </abstract>::line_number::4",727,false

For complex systems containing a large number of variables and constraints, the simulation frequently is intractable or results in a large, incomprehensible behavioral description. Abstraction and aggregation techniques are required during the simulation to eliminate irrelevant details and highlight the important characteristics of the behavior. The total temporal ordering of unrelated events provided by a traditional state-based qualitative representation is one such irrelevant distinction. Model decomposition and simulation addresses this problem. Model decomposition uses a causal analysis of the model to partition the variables into tightly connected components. The components are simulated separately in the order dictated by the causal analysis beginning with causally upstream components. Information from the simulation of causally upstream components is used to constrain the behavior of downstream components. If a feedback loop exists between components or a set of components are acausally related, then a concurrent simulation is performed for these components. A truth maintenance system is used to record and retract assumptions made during this concurrent simulation. Model decomposition provides a general architecture which separates the method of simulation from the model decomposition algorithm. This architecture can be used to introduce alternative abstraction techniques to eliminate other irrelevant distinctions.  </abstract>::line_number::6",728,false

The language is small, because no construct was introduced without compelling justification; as with yacc [8], general-purpose computation is done in a host language. MAWL offers conveniences such as control abstraction, persistent state management, synchronization, and shared memory. In addition, the MAWL compiler performs static checking designed to prevent common Web programming errors. In this paper we discuss the design and engineering of MAWL. We describe the problems MAWL is intended to solve, and then discuss our design choices in the context of our general language design philosophy, We also include an appendix of commentary on several short MAWL programs.  </abstract>::line_number::5",729,false

We prove that all of Karp's 21 original NP -complete problems have a version that's hard to approximate. These versions are obtained from the original problems by adding essentially the same, simple constraint. We further show that these problems are absurdly hard to approximate. In fact, no polynomial-time algorithm can even approximate log (k) of the magnitude of these problems to within any constant factor, where log (k) denotes the logarithm iterated k times, unless N P is recognized by slightly superpolynomial randomized machines. We use the same technique to improve the constant * such that MAX CLIQUE is hard to approximate to within a factor of n * . Finally, we show that it is even harder to approximate two counting problems: counting the number of satisfying assignments to a monotone 2-SAT formula and computing the permanent of -1,0,1 matrices.  </abstract>::line_number::2",731,false

It would be highly available in spite of component failures. It would require minimal human administration, and administration would not become more complex as more components were added. Frangipani is a new file system that approximates this ideal, yet was relatively easy to build because of its two-layer structure. The lower layer is Petal (described in an earlier paper), a distributed storage service that provides incrementally scalable, highly available, automatically managed virtual disks. In the upper layer, multiple machines run the same Frangipani file system code on top of a shared Petal virtual disk, using a distributed lock service to ensure coherence. Frangipani is meant to run in a cluster of machines that are under a common administration and can communicate securely. Thus the machines trust one another and the shared virtual disk approach is practical. Of course, a Frangipani file system can be exported to untrusted machines using ordinary network file access protocols. We have implemented Frangipani on a collection of Alphas running DIGITAL Unix 4.0. Initial measurements indicate that Frangipani has excellent single-server performance and scales well as servers are added.  </abstract>::line_number::4",733,false

Past research in message logging has focused on studying the relative overhead imposed by pessimistic, optimistic, and causal protocols during failure-free executions. In this paper, we give the first experimental evaluation of the performance of these protocols during recovery. We discover that, if a single failure is to be tolerated, pessimistic and causal protocols perform best, because they avoid rollbacks of correct processes. For multiple failures, however, the dominant factor in determining performance becomes where the recovery information is logged (i.e. at the sender, at the receiver, or replicated at a subset of the processes in the system) rather than when this information is logged (i.e. if logging is synchronous or asynchronous). From our results, we distil a few lessons that can guide the design of message-logging protocols that combine low-overhead during failure-free executions with fast recovery.  </abstract>::line_number::7",734,false

It is assumed that such mesh architectures employ cut-through or worm-hole routing. The primary focus is on avoiding network conflicts in the various proposed algorithms. We give algorithms for performing a conflict-free minimum-spanning tree broadcast, a pipelined algorithm that is similar to Ho and Johnsson's EDST algorithm for hypercubes, and a novel scatter-collect approach that is a natural choice for communication libraries due to its simplicity. Results obtained on the Intel Paragon system are included.  </abstract>::line_number::18",737,false

A number of contributions are made, including a new approach to matrix distribution, new insights into layering parallel linear algebra libraries, and the application of object based programming techniques which have recently become popular for (parallel) scientific libraries. We present an overview of a prototype library, the SL Library, which incorporates these ideas. Preliminary performance data shows this more application-centric approach to libraries does not necessarily adversely impact performance, compared to more traditional approaches.  </abstract>::line_number::5",738,false

Our approach is unique in that it allows essentially all of RAM to be filled with the current portion of the matrix (slab) to be updated and factored, thereby greatly improving the computation to I/O ratio over previous approaches. Experiences and performance are reported for the Cray T3D system.  </abstract>::line_number::9",739,false

The development of NetSolve was motivated by the need for an easy-to-use, efficient mechanism for using computational resources remotely. Ease of use is obtained as a result of different interfaces, some of which require no programming effort from the user. Good performance is ensured by a load-balancing policy that enables NetSolve to use the computational resources available as efficiently as possible. NetSolve offers the ability to look for computational resources on a network, choose the best one available, solve a problem (with retry for fault-tolerance), and return the answer to the user.  </abstract>::line_number::12",741,false

The main technical result of the paper is a proof that a simple robot programming language is universal, in that any effectively achievable goal can be achieved by getting the robot to execute one of the robot programs. The significance of this result is at least two fold. First, it is in many ways similar to the equivalence theorem between Turing machines and recursive functions, but applied to robots whose actions are specified by an action theory. Secondly, it provides formal justifications for using the simple robot programming language as a foundation for our work on robotics.  </abstract>::line_number::10",742,false

To find out, simply perform the operator ff on D 0 (by applying ff's elementary add and delete revision operators to D 0 ). We describe this process as progressing the database D 0 in response to the action ff. In this paper, we consider the general problem of progressing an initial database in response to a given sequence of actions. We appeal to the situation calculus and an axiomatization of actions which addresses the frame problem (Reiter [13], Lin and Reiter [8]). This setting is considerably more general than STRIPS. Our results concerning progression are mixed. The (surprising) bad news is that, in general, to characterize a progressed database we must appeal to second order logic. The good news is that there are many useful special cases for which we can compute the progressed database in first order logic; not only that, we can do so efficiently.  </abstract>::line_number::5",744,false

It was claimed that these bounds are not tight. Here we improve these bounds to 1.3125 and 61 48 1:271, respectively, and give efficient algorithms to find approximations of such quality. We also prove that for Zelikovsky's heuristic this bound cannot be less than 1.3.  </abstract>::line_number::3",746,false

An additional useful feature found in many proposals is a nondeterministic choice operator. Similar in nature to the CSP alternative command, this operator allows different possible actions to be guarded by sends or receives. Choice is difficult to implement in a distributed environment because it requires offering many potential communications but closing only one. In this paper we present the first distributed, deadlock-free algorithm for choice.  </abstract>::line_number::5",747,false

Applications that use the toolkit are written at an assembly-language level of abstraction, but they recognize and emit binary. Guided by a short instruction-set specification, the toolkit generates all the bit-manipulating code. The toolkit's specification language uses four concepts: fields and tokens describe parts of instructions, patterns describe binary encodings of instructions or groups of instructions, and constructors map between the assembly-language and binary levels. These concepts are suitable for describing both CISC and RISC machines; we have written specifications for the MIPS R3000, SPARC, and Intel 486 instruction sets. We have used the toolkit to help write two applications: a debugger and a linker. The toolkit generates efficient code; for example, the linker emits binary up to 15% faster than it emits assembly language, making it 1.7-2 times faster to produce an a.out directly than by using the assembler.  </abstract>::line_number::6",748,false

In this paper we investigate the consequences of abandoning this basic axiom, and instead we allow routing topologies that correspond to arbitrary graphs (i.e., where cycles are allowed). We show that non-tree routing can significantly improve signal propagation delay, reduce signal skew, and afford increased reliability with respect to open faults that may be caused by manufacturing defects and electro-migration. Simulations on uniformly-distributed nets indicate that depending on net size and technology parameters, our non-tree routing construction reduces maximum sourse-sink SPICE delay by an average of up to 62%, and reduces signal skew by an average of up to 63%, as compared with Steiner routing. Moreover, up to 77% of the total wirelength in non-trees can tolerate an open fault without disconnecting the circuit.  </abstract>::line_number::5",749,false

They are therefore quite attractive for use as compute servers for multiprogramming and parallel application workloads. Process scheduling and memory management, however, remain challenging due to the distributed main memory found on such machines. This paper examines the effects of OS scheduling and page migration policies on the performance of such compute servers. Our experiments are done on the Stan-ford DASH, a distributed-memory cache-coherent multiprocessor. We show that for our multiprogramming workloads consisting of sequential jobs, the traditional Unix scheduling policy does very poorly. In contrast, a policy incorporating cluster and cache affinity along with a simple page-migration algorithm offers up to twofold performance improvement. For our workloads consisting of multiple parallel applications, we compare space-sharing policies that divide the processors among the applications to time-slicing policies such as standard Unix or gang scheduling. We show that space-sharing policies can achieve better processor utilization due to the operating point effect, but time-slicing policies benefit strongly from user-level data distribution. Our initial experience with automatic page migration suggests that policies based only on TLB miss information can be quite effective, and useful for addressing the data distribution problems of space-sharing sched-ulers.  </abstract>::line_number::4",750,false

The process is well understood in the case of unions of select-project-join queries (i.e., nonrecursive datalog). For arbitrary datalog programs, however, the issue has largely remained an unsolved problem. This paper studies this problem and shows when semantic query optimization can be completely done in recursive rules provided that order constraints and negated EDB subgoals appear only in the recursive rules, but not in the ic's. If either order constraints or negated EDB subgoals are introduced in ic's, then the problem of semantic query optimization becomes undecidable. Since semantic query optimization is closely related to the containment problem of a datalog program in a union of conjunctive queries, our results also imply new decidability and undecidability results for that problem when order constraints and negated EDB subgoals are used.  </abstract>::line_number::8",752,false

The lexical nature of cpp creates numerous problems for software engineers and their tools, all stemming from the chasm between the engineer's view of the source code and the compiler's view. The simplest way to reduce this problem is to minimize use of the preprocessor. In light of the data collected in a prior empirical analysis, this paper describes a tool to aid the software engineer in analyses targeted at replacing preprocessor constructs with language features. Existing tools for analyzing C source in the context of the preprocessor are unsuitable for such transformations. This work introduces a new approach: tightly integrating the preprocessor with a C language parser, permitting the code to be analyzed at both the preprocessor and syntactic levels simultaneously. The front-end framework, called PCp 3 , combines a preprocessor, a parser, and arbitrary Perl subroutine hooks invoked upon various preprocessor and parser events. PCp 3 's strengths and weaknesses are discussed in the context of several program understanding and transformation tools, including a conservative analysis to support replacing cpp's #define directives with C++ language features.  </abstract>::line_number::4",753,false

However, prefetching is not without costs, particularly on a multiprocessor. Prefetching can negatively affect bus utilization, overall cache miss rates, memory latencies and data sharing. We simulate the effects of a compiler-directed prefetching algorithm, running on a range of bus-based multiprocessors. We show that, despite a high memory latency, this architecture does not necessarily support prefetching well, in some cases actually causing performance degradations. We pinpoint several problems with prefetching on a shared memory architecture (additional conflict misses, no reduction in the data sharing traffic and associated latencies, a multiprocessor's greater sensitivity to memory utilization and the sensitivity of the cache hit rate to prefetch distance) and measure their effect on performance. We then solve those problems through architectural techniques and heuristics for prefetching that could be easily incorporated into a compiler: 1) victim caching, which eliminates most of the cache conflict misses caused by prefetching in a direct-mapped cache, 2) special prefetch algorithms for shared data, which significantly improve the ability of our basic prefetching algorithm to prefetch invalidation misses, and 3) compiler-based shared data restructuring, which eliminates many of the invalidation misses the basic prefetching algorithm doesn't predict. The combined effect of these improvements is to make prefetching effective over a much wider range of memory architectures.  </abstract>::line_number::3",755,false

While there has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current spoken-language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the screen system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of screen's architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.  </abstract>::line_number::8",756,false

Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies some general conditions.  </abstract>::line_number::6",757,false

This algorithm is especially effective when neither of the inputs to the join have an index on the joining attribute. Such a situation could arise if both inputs to the join are intermediate results in a complex query, or in a parallel environment where the inputs must be dynamically redistributed. The PBSM algorithm partitions the inputs into manageable chunks, and joins them using a computational geometry based plane-sweeping technique. This paper also presents a performance study comparing the the traditional indexed nested loops join algorithm, a spatial join algorithm based on joining spatial indices, and the PBSM algorithm. These comparisons are based on complete implementations of these algorithms in Paradise, a database system for handling GIS applications. Using real data sets, the performance study examines the behavior of these spatial join algorithms in a variety of situations, including the cases when both, one, or none of the inputs to the join have an suitable index. The study also examines the effect of clustering the join inputs on the performance of these join algorithms. The performance comparisons demonstrates the feasibility, and applicability of the PBSM join algorithm.  </abstract>::line_number::4",759,false

By contrast, a demand dataflow-analysis algorithm determines whether a single given dataflow fact holds at a single given point. This paper presents a new demand algorithm for interprocedural dataflow analysis. The algorithm has four important properties: g It provides precise (meet-over-all-interprocedurally-valid-paths) solutions to a large class of problems. g It has a polynomial worst-case cost for both a single demand and a sequence of all possible demands. g The worst-case total cost of the sequence of all possible demands is no worse than the worst-case cost of a single run of the current best exhaustive algorithm. g Experimental results show that in many situations (e.g., when only a small number of demands are made, or when most demands are answered yes) the demand algorithm is superior to the current best exhaustive algorithm.  </abstract>::line_number::3",760,false

The convention in most languages is that the input is scanned left to right, and each token identified is a maximal munch of the remaining inputthe longest prefix of the remaining input that is a token of the language. Most textbooks on compiling have extensive discussions of lexical analysis in terms of finite-state automata and regular expressions: Token classes are defined by a set of regular expressions R i , 1 i k, and the lexical analyzer is based on some form of finite-state automaton for recognizing the language L (R 1 + R 2 + . . . + R k ). However, the treatment is unsatisfactory in one respect: The theory of finite-state automata assumes that the end of the input stringi.e., the right-hand-side boundary of the candidate for recognitionis known a priori, whereas a scanner must identify the next token without knowing a definite bound on the extent of the token. Although most of the standard compiler textbooks discuss this issue, the solution they sketch out is one thatfor certain sets of token definitionscan cause the scanner to exhibit quadratic behavior in the worst case. This property is not only dissatisfying, it blemishes an otherwise elegant treatment of lexical analysis. In this paper, we rectify this defect: We show that, given a deterministic finite-state automaton that recognizes the tokens of a language, maximal-munch tokenization can always be performed in time linear in the size of the input.  </abstract>::line_number::3",761,false

The DEVise framework is being implemented in a tool that has been already successfully applied to a variety of real applications by a number of user groups. Our emphasis is on developing an intuitive yet powerful set of querying and visualization primitives that can be easily combined to develop a rich set of visual presentations that integrate data from a wide range of application domains. While DEVise is a powerful visualization tool, its greatest strengths are the ability to interactively explore a visual presentation of the data at any level of detail (including retrieving individual data records), and the ability to seamlessly query and combine data from a variety of local and remote sources. In this paper, we present the DEVise framework, describe the current tool, and report on our experience in applying it to several real applications.  </abstract>::line_number::4",762,false

This paper introduces GreedyDual-Size, which incorporates locality with cost and size concerns in a simple and non-parameterized fashion for high performance. Trace-driven simulations show that with the appropriate cost definition, GreedyDual-Size outperforms existing web cache replacement algorithms in many aspects, including hit ratios, latency reduction and network cost reduction. In addition, GreedyDual-Size can potentially improve the performance of main-memory caching of Web documents.  </abstract>::line_number::4",763,false

The impact of such variability becomes very clear when viewed in the context of structural equation modeling (e.g. Muthen 1979, 1983, 1984, 1988). The structural equation formulation also provides insight into the assumptions and differences in interpretation of regression coefficients of these various methods of analysis. We explore the potential for using structural equations to model random effects and to adjust for measurement error, and in the process compare results from marginal modeling using a SAS GEE routine (Karim and Zeger, 1988), Qu's GAUSS program (Qu, 1992) for generalized mixed models using GEE, the MIXOR package for cluster-specific mixed effects models (Hedeker and Gibbons, 1994), and LIS-COMP (Muthen, 1988) for structural equation models. These approaches are illustrated in a longitudinal data set of sleep disorders.  </abstract>::line_number::6",764,false

Both differ in their time and space complexity as well as in the preciseness due to properties of the abstract domains and transfer functions. We have developed a data flow analyzer generator PAG [2] which is able to produce interprocedural analyzers for both techniques. We specified two variants of constant propagation working in an ANSI-C compiler; a copy constant propagation that uses distributive transfer function and can be solved precisely, even interprocedurally [13], and a full constant propagator which includes an interpreter for expressions of the language. We present the practical relevant results applying both analyzers to a rather fair set of real-world programs and compare the space/time consumption of the analyzers versus their preciseness.  </abstract>::line_number::6",766,false

Kerberos provides an alternative approach whereby a trusted third-party authentication service is used to verify users' identities. This paper gives an overview of the Kerberos authentication model as implemented for MIT's Project Athena. It describes the protocols used by clients, servers, and Kerberos to achieve authentication. It also describes the management and replication of the database required. The views of Kerberos as seen by the user, programmer, and administrator are described. Finally, the role of Kerberos in the larger Athena picture is given, along with a list of applications that presently use Kerberos for user authentication. We describe the addition of Kerberos authentication to the Sun Network File System as a case study for integrating Kerberos with an existing application.  </abstract>::line_number::15",767,false

The DEVise framework is being implemented in a tool that has been already successfully applied to a variety of real applications by a number of user groups. Our emphasis is on developing an intuitive yet powerful set of querying and visualization primitives that can be easily combined to develop a rich set of visual presentations that integrate data from a wide range of application domains. While DEVise is a powerful visualization tool, its greatest strengths are the ability to interactively explore a visual presentation of the data at any level of detail (includ-ing retrieving individual data records), and the ability to seamlessly query and combine data from a variety of local and remote sources. In this paper, we present the DEVise framework, describe the current tool, and report on our experience in applying it to several real applications.  </abstract>::line_number::4",768,false

In this paper we propose a new approach to performance modeling of multiprogrammed processor scheduling policies, that of interpolation approximations. We first define a workload model that contains parameters for the essential properties of parallel applications with respect to scheduling discipline performance, yet lends itself to mathematical analysis. Key features of the workload model include general distribution of total job processing time, general distribution of available job parallelism, and a simple characterization of parallelism overheads. We then show that one can find specific values of the system parameters for which the parallel system under a given scheduling policy reduces to a queueing system with a known (closed-form) solution. Finally, interpolation between the points with known solutions is used to arrive at mean response time estimates that hold over the entire system parameter space. The interpolation approximations readily yield insight into policy behavior and are easy to evaluate for systems with hundreds of processors. We illustrate the approach by developing and validating models of three scheduling policies, under the assumptions of linear job execution rates and independence between job parallelism and processing time. We discuss several insights and results obtained from the analysis of the three policies under the assumed workloads. One result clarifies and generalizes observations in two previous simulation studies of how policy performance varies with the coefficient of variation in job processing requirement. Another result of the interpolation models yields new insight into how policy performance varies with job parallelism. We also comment on the generalizations of these insights for workloads with less restrictive assumptions.  </abstract>::line_number::6",769,false

We address the first question by comparing policies (previous as well as new) that differ only in whether or not they use execution rate characteristics and by examining a wider range of the workload parameter space than previous studies. We address the second question by comparing a simple two-level queueing policy with RTC scheduling in the second level queue against RTC policies that don't allow any preemption and against dynamic equiallocation (EQ). Using simulation to estimate mean response times we find that for promising RTC policies such as adaptive static partitioning (ASP) and shortest demand first (SDF), a maximum allocation constraint that is for all practical purposes independent of avg and pws provides greater and more consistent improvement in policy performance than using avg or pws. Also, under the assumption that job demand information is unavailable to the scheduler we show that the ASP-max policy outperforms all previous high performance RTC policies for workloads with coefficient of variation in processing requirement greater than one. Furthermore, a two-level queue that allows at most one preemption per job outperforms ASP-max but is not competitive with EQ.  </abstract>::line_number::8",771,false

In this paper we describe RD-OPT, an efficient algorithm for constructing DCT quantization tables with optimal rate-distortion tradeoffs for a given image. The algorithm uses DCT coefficient distribution statistics in a novel way and uses a dynamic programming strategy to produce optimal quantization tables over a wide range of rates and distortions. It can be used to compress images at any desired signal-to-noise ratio or compressed size.  </abstract>::line_number::11",772,false

Furthermore, C 0 should be a semantically meaningful generalization of C; namely, there must exist an instantiation of C 0 that is equivalent in functionality to C. In this paper, we present an algorithm that generalizes C functions via type inference. The original functions operate on specific data types; the result of generalization is a collection of C++ function templates that operate on parameterized types. This version of the generalization problem is useful in the context of converting existing C programs to C++.  </abstract>::line_number::7",773,false

The interconvertibility of these two formalisms offers an conceptual advantage akin to the advantage gained from the interconvertibility of finite-state automata and regular expressions in language theory, namely, a problem can be formulated in whichever formalism is most natural. It also offers some insight into the O(n 3 ) bottleneck for different types of program-analysis problems, and allows results previously obtained for context-free-language reachability problems to be applied to set constraint problems.  </abstract>::line_number::3",774,false

This paper provides a means for comparing various computer codes for solving large scale mixed complementarity problems. We discuss inadequacies in how solvers are currently compared, and present a testing environment that addresses these inadequacies. This testing environment consists of a library of test problems, along with GAMS and MATLAB interfaces that allow these problems to be easily accessed. The environment is intended for use as a tool by other researchers to better understand both their algorithms and their implementations, and to direct research toward problem classes that are currently the most challenging. As an initial benchmark, eight different algorithm implementations for large scale mixed complementarity problems are briefly described and tested with default parameter settings using the new testing environment.  </abstract>::line_number::16",776,false

Several types of multi-coordination methods for block-angular programs are considered. We present a computational comparison of synchronous multi-coordination methods. The most efficient of these approaches is shown to involve an intermediate number of blocks in the coordination phase. We also develop a new stabilization algorithm and present asynchronous multi-coordination schemes, which are particularly useful when the number of blocks exceeds the number of available processors or when the block sizes vary significantly.  </abstract>::line_number::2",777,false

In this paper we examine preconditioning operators for regular elliptic systems of partial differential operators. We obtain general conditions under which the preconditioned systems are bounded. We also provide some useful guidelines for choosing left and right preconditioning operators for regular elliptic systems. The condition numbers of the discrete operators arising from these preconditioned operators are shown to be bounded independent of grid spacing. Several examples of the two-dimensional regular elliptic systems are discussed, including scalar elliptic operators and the Stokes operator with several different boundary conditions. Several preconditioners for these regular elliptic systems are presented and used in numerical experiments illustrating the theoretical results.  </abstract>::line_number::7",778,false

One of the key issues for object management systems is distribution. Addressing this issue in the context of software engineering applications is particularly challenging because they have widely varying object access profiles. Two fundamental approaches to dealing with distribution are the object server architecture, where objects are shipped to the application program, and the operation server architecture, where operation requests are shipped to where the objects reside. We compare these architectures experimentally to determine the conditions under which each performs better.  </abstract>::line_number::6",779,false

There are many different approaches to computing points-to information. This paper addresses techniques for flow- and context-insensitive in-terprocedural analysis of stack-based storage. The paper makes two contributions to work in this area: * The first contribution is a set of experiments that explore the trade-offs between techniques previously defined by Lars Andersen and Bjarne Steens-gaard. The former has a cubic worst-case running time, while the latter is essentially linear. However, the former may be much more precise than the latter. We have found that in practice, Ander-sen's algorithm is consistently more precise than Steensgaard's. For small programs, there is very little difference in the times required by the two approaches; however, for larger programs, Ander-sen's algorithm can be much slower than Steens gaard's. * The second contribution is the definition of two new algorithms. The first algorithm can be tuned so that its worst-case time and space requirements, as well as its accuracy range from those of Steens-gaard to those of Andersen. We have experimented with several versions of this algorithm; one version provided a significant increase in accuracy over Steensgaard's algorithm, while keeping the running time within a factor of two. The second algorithm uses the first as a subroutine. Its worst-case time and space requirements are a factor of log N (where N is the number of variables in the program) worse than those of Steensgaard's algorithm. In practice, it appears to  </abstract>::line_number::5",781,false

This improves query response time. However, the decision of what and how much to precompute is a difficult one. It is further complicated by the fact that precomputation in the presence of hierarchies can result in an unintuitively large increase in the amount of storage required by the database. Hence, it is interesting and useful to estimate the storage blowup that will result from a proposed set of precomputations without actually computing them. We propose three strategies for this problem: one based on sampling, one based on mathematical approximation, and one based on probabilistic counting. We investigate the accuracy of these algorithms in estimating the blowup for different data distributions and database schemas. The algorithm based upon probabilistic counting is particularly attractive, since it estimates the storage blowup to within provable error bounds while performing only a single scan of the data.  </abstract>::line_number::4",783,false

In the absence of clustering criteria, the goal is to maximize storage utilization. For main-memory based systems, simple heuristics exist that provide reasonable space utilization in the worst case and excellent utilization in typical cases. However, the storage management problem for databases includes significant additional challenges, such as minimizing I/O traffic, coping with crash recovery, and gracefully integrating space management with locking and logging. We survey several object placement algorithms, including techniques that can be found in commercial and research database systems. We then present a new object placement algorithm that we have designed for use in Shore, an object-oriented database system under development at the University of Wisconsin|Madison. Finally, we present results from a series of experiments involving actual Shore implementations of some of these algorithms. Our results show that while current object placement algorithms have serious performance deficiencies, including excessive CPU or main memory overhead, I/O traffic, or poor disk utilization, our new algorithm consistently demonstrates excellent performance in all of these areas.  </abstract>::line_number::10",784,false

Using a standard transformation such algorithms can easily be converted to on-line learning algorithms that use membership queries. Under such a transformation the number of equivalence queries made by the query algorithm directly corresponds to the number of mistakes made by the on-line algorithm. In this paper we consider several of the natural classes known to be learnable in this setting, and investigate the minimum number of equivalence queries with accompanying counterexamples (or equivalently the minimum number of mistakes in the on-line model) that can be made by a learning algorithm that makes a polynomial number of membership queries and uses polynomial computation time. We are able both to reduce the number of equivalence queries used by the previous algorithms and often to prove matching lower bounds. As an example, consider the class of DNF formulas over n variables with at most k = O(log n) terms. Previously, the algorithm of Blum and Rudich [BR92] provided the best known upper bound of 2 O(k) log n for the minimum number of equivalence queries needed for exact identification. We greatly improve on this upper bound showing that exactly k counterexamples are needed if the learner knows k a priori and exactly k +1 counterexamples are needed if the learner does not know k a priori. This exactly matches known lower bounds [BC92]. For many of our results we obtain a complete characterization of the tradeoff between the number of membership and equivalence queries needed for exact identification. The classes we consider here are monotone DNF formulas, Horn sentences, O(log n)-term DNF formulas, read-k sat-j DNF formulas, read-once formulas over various bases, and deterministic finite automata.  </abstract>::line_number::19",785,false

Network traffic can be reduced significantly if caching is utilized effectively. As an effort in this direction we study the replacement problem that arises in caching of multimedia objects. The size of objects and the cost of cache misses are assumed non-uniform. The non-uniformity of size is inherent in multimedia objects, and the non-uniformity of cost is due to the non-uniformity of size and the fact that the objects are scattered throughout the network. Although a special case of this problem, i.e. the case of uniform size and cost, has been extensively studied, the general case needs a great deal of study. We present a dynamic programming method of optimally solving the off-line and on-line versions of this problem, and discuss the complexity of this method.  </abstract>::line_number::3",787,false

Satisfying these demands requires a thorough understanding of key factors affecting Web server performance. This paper presents empirical analysis illustrating how dynamic and static adaptivity can enhance Web server performance. Two research contributions support this conclusion. First, the paper presents results from a comprehensive empirical study of Web servers (such as Apache, Netscape Enterprise, PHTTPD, Zeus, and JAWS) over high-speed ATM networks. This study illustrates their relative performance and precisely pinpoints the server design choices that cause performance bottlenecks. We found that once network and disk I/O overheads are reduced to negligible constant factors, the main determinants of Web server performance are its protocol processing path and concurrency strategy. Moreover, no single strategy performs optimally for all load conditions and traffic types. Second, we describe the design techniques and optimizations used to develop JAWS, our high-performance, adaptive Web server. JAWS is an object-oriented Web server that was explicitly designed to alleviate the performance bottlenecks we identified in existing Web servers. It consistently outperforms all other Web servers over ATM networks. The performance optimizations used in JAWS include adaptive pre-spawned threading, fixed headers, cached date processing, and file caching. In addition, JAWS uses a novel software architecture that substantially improves its portability and flex This work was funded in part by NSF grant NCR-9628218, Object Technologies International, Eastman Kodak, and Siemens MED. ibility, relative to other Web servers. Our empirical results illustrate that highly efficient communication software is not antithetical to highly flexible software.  </abstract>::line_number::8",789,false

As gigabit networks become pervasive, inefficient middleware will force programmers to use lower-level mechanisms to achieve the necessary transfer rates. This is a serious problem for mission/life-critical applications (such as satellite surveillance and medical imaging). This paper compares the performance of several widely used communication middleware mechanisms on a high-speed ATM network. The middleware ranged from lower-level mechanisms (such as socket-based C interfaces and C++ wrappers for sockets) to higher-level mechanisms (such as RPC, hand-optimized RPC and two implementations of CORBA - Orbix 2.0.1 and ORBeline 2.0). These measurements reveal that the lower-level C and C++ implementations outperform the CORBA implementations significantly (the best CORBA throughput for remote transfer was roughly 75 to 80 percent of the best C/C++ throughput for sending scalar data types and only around 33 percent for sending structs containing binary fields), and the hand-optimized RPC code performs slightly better than the CORBA implementations. Our goal in precisely pinpointing the sources of overhead for communication middleware is to develop scalable and flexible CORBA implementations that can deliver gigabit data rates to applications.  </abstract>::line_number::6",790,false

Computers today rely heavily on good utilization of their cache memory subsystems. Compilers are optimized for business applications, not scientific computing ones, however. Automatic tiling of basic numerical algorithms is simply not provided by any compiler. Thus, absolutely terrible cache performance is normal for scientific computing applications. Multigrid algorithms combine several numerical algorithms into a more complicated algorithm. In this paper, an algorithm is derived that allows for data to pass through cache exactly once per multigrid level during a V cycle before the level changes. This is optimal cache usage for large problems that do not fit entirely in cache. The new algorithm would appear to be quite complicated to implement, leading to spaghetti coding. Actually, an efficient implementation of the algorithm requires a rigid, highly structured coding style. A coding example is given that is suitable for almost all common discretization methods. Numerical experiments are provided that show that the new algorithm is up to an integer factor faster than the traditional implementation method for common multigrid parameter choices.  </abstract>::line_number::2",791,false

We study a method for parallel solution of elliptic partial differential equations which decomposes the problem into a number of independent subproblems on subspaces of the underlying solution space. Using symmetries of the domain, we obtain up to 64 such subproblems for a 3 dimensional cube and the method reduces to a direct solver. In the general case, or when the subproblems are solved only approximately, the method becomes an iterative method or can be used as a preconditioner.

Matrix-matrix multiplication is normally computed using one of the BLAS or a reinvention of part of the BLAS. Unfortunately, the BLAS were designed with small matrices in mind. When huge, well conditioned matrices are multiplied together, the BLAS perform like the blahs, even on vector machines. For matrices where the coefficients are well conditioned, Winograd's variant of Strassen's algorithm offers some relief, but is rarely available in a quality form on most computers. We reconsider this method and offer a highly portable solution based on the Level 3 BLAS interface.  </abstract>::line_number::2",793,false

These higher-order predicates parallel the higher-order functionals or combinators which form an established part of contemporary functional programming methodology. The suggested toolbox of higher-order predicates for composing logic programs is derived from one universal higher-order predicate. They take the form of recursion operators (in particular for expressing recursion along lists) intended to cover all commonly occurring recursion schemes in logic programming practice. Their theoretical sufficiency is proved and their practical adequacy is argued through examples. The recursion operators, denoting higher-order relations rather than functions, are brought about straightforwardly through a well-known metalogic programming technique, rendering superfluous the need for special higher-order unification mechanisms.  </abstract>::line_number::5",795,false

Our approach is designed to handle the problems introduced by optimizing compilers, i.e. that the structure of the object code is very different from the structure of the source code. The co-transformer allows us to keep track of how different compiler transformations, including optimizations, influence the execution time of a program. This allows us to statically calculate the execution time of a program at the object code level, using information about the program execution obtained at the source code level.  </abstract>::line_number::9",796,false

Pvmmake is a PVM application which allows a user to send files, execute commands, and receive results from a single machine on any machine in the virtual machine. Its actions are controlled by the contents of a configuration file. Its most common use is to enable management of the development of a parallel program in a heterogeneous environment. A utility with the same features, mpimake, was coded up to run under LAM. Genetic programming is an algorithm which evolves an algorithm in the form of a program to solve your input problem. The implementation under MPI requires the transfer of dynamic data structures such as lists and trees. This paper discusses the match between the requirements of this algorithm and the datatype feature in MPI. A new library, MPI DataStruct is being developed which can transfer dynamic data structures, created with pointers, without intervention by the user.  </abstract>::line_number::5",797,false

In the modern Internet environment, various types of data sources have become accessible, including multimedia data and web pages. Some of the fundamental assumptions in traditional databases, such as the existence of a global schema and data consistency maintained by a Data Base Administrator, are no longer true in many of the new data sources. We outline the DIOM [LP95b] object-oriented approach to build interoperable heterogeneous information systems despite the absence of global schema and the presence of data inconsistency. We describe the metadata catalog management component of DIOM, a key service in the support for interoperation among heterogeneous information sources. To support a flexible and customizable conection between information consumers and information producers, DIOM metadata catalog development utilizes the adaptive specification mechanisms, provided in DIOM interface description language, for explicit description of information consumers' domain query requirements and for object-oriented abstractions of information producers' information sources.  </abstract>::line_number::8",798,false

In optimistic replication, updates can be made concurrently to different file replicas, resulting in multiple versions of the file. To recover from these conflicting updates, after-the fact conflict resolution actions are required to recombine multiple versions into one. This paper defines these concepts and discusses approaches to measure them in optimistically replicated systems. Measurement of the number of conflicting updates and conflict resolution is important to judge the practicality of optimistic replication. An environment where conflicting updates are frequent will not be attractive since users cannot assume they have up-to-date data. Although many conflicts can be automatically resolved, some conflicts require user intervention; such conflicts cannot be too common. This paper shows an approach to measure the number of conflicting updates. From this measurement we derive the actual amount of work done by the user or system to resolve conflicts and the minimum amount of work required to resolve conflicts.  </abstract>::line_number::4",800,false

We present a technique to study relations between weak and strong fi-normalisations in various typed -calculi. We first introduce a translation which translates a -term into a I-term, and show that a -term is strongly fi-normalisable if and only if its translation is weakly fi-normalisable. We then prove that the translation preserves typability of -terms in various typed -calculi. This enables us to establish the equivalence between weak and strong fi-normalisations in these typed -calculi. This translation can deal with Curry typing as well as Church typing, strengthening some recent closely related results. This may bring some insights into answering whether weak and strong fi-normalisations in all pure type systems are equivalent.  </abstract>::line_number::4",801,false

We focus on syntactic processing and present some key elements of the projects parser that allow it to deal successfully with technical texts. The parser is fully implemented and tested on a variety of real texts; improvements and enhancements are in progress. Because our knowledge acquisition method assumes no a priori model of the domain of the source text, the parser relies as much as possible on lexical and syntactic clues. That is why it strives for full syntactic analysis rather than some form of text skimming. We present a practical approach to four acknowledged difficult problems which to date have no generally acceptable answers: phrase attachment; time constraints for problematic input (how to avoid long and unproductive computation); parsing conjoined structures (how to preserve broad coverage without losing control of the parsing process); and the treatment of fragmentary input or fragments that are a byproduct of a fallback parsing strategy. We review recent related work and conclude by listing several future work items.  </abstract>::line_number::10",803,false

Such a specification, though impossible or unreasonable to implement, can go undetected and be verified to be correct. It can also lead to logical statements that do not preserve causality, which in turn can have undesirable consequences. Such a specification, called an infeasible specification here, can be subtle and hard to locate. This note shows how the logic of cryptographic protocols by Gong, Needham, and Yahalom can be enhanced with a notion of eligibility to preserve causality of beliefs and detect infeasible specifications. It is conceivable that this technique can be adopted in other similar logics.  </abstract>::line_number::6",805,false

The primary goal of the architecture is to make common group oriented abstractions robust in hostile settings, in order to facilitate the construction of high performance distributed applications that can tolerate both component failures and malicious attacks. These abstractions include process groups and causal group multicast. Moreover, a delegation and access control scheme is proposed for use in group oriented systems.

Heuristics are described that overcome the difficulty of computing the indexing WAM code. In order to become independent from a concrete WAM instruction set, an abstract graphical representation based on DAGs (called DAXes) is introduced. The paper includes a COMMON LISP listing of the main heuristics implemented; the algorithms were developed for RELFUN, a relational-plus-functional language, but can easily be used in arbitrary PROLOG implementations.  </abstract>::line_number::5",811,false

A relational-functional kernel language is introduced that integrates essential declarative constructs: logic variables and non-determinism from the relational paradigm with nested and higher-order operations from the functional paradigm. Operator definitions use `valued clauses', subsuming relational Horn clauses and functional (conditional or unconditional) directed equations. Their semantics complements the atoms in relational Herbrand models by `molecules', which pair functions, applied to argument terms, with returned-value terms. All abstract notions are illustrated by concrete declarative programs.  </abstract>::line_number::5",812,false

In this paper we focus on one reliability issue the antenna effect in the context of 3-layer channel routing. We first present an antenna effect model in 3-layer channel routing and, based on this, an antenna effect cost function is proposed. A layer reassignment approach is adopted to minimize this cost function and we show that the layer reassignment problem can be formulated as a network bipartitioning problem. Experimental results show that the antenna effect can be reduced considerably by applying the proposed technique. Compared with previous work, one advantage of our approach is that no extra channel area is required for antenna effect minimization. We show that layer reassignment technique can be used in yield-related critical area minimization in 3-layer channel routing as well. The trade-off between these two objectives is also presented.  </abstract>::line_number::4",813,false

In this paper, we study the problem of crosstalk minimization in 3-layer HVH channel routing. A heuristic algorithm that combines layer reassignment and track reassignment is presented. This algorithm can iteratively modify the layout so that the crosstalk in the channel is minimized.

They wish to generate common randomness by communicating interactively over the two channels. Assuming that Alice and Bob are allowed access to independent external random sources at rates (in bits per step of communication) of H A and H B , respectively, we show that they can generate common randomness at a rate of max f min [H A + H(W jQ); I(P ; V )] + min [H B + H(V jP ); I(Q; W )] g bits per step. Here, V is the channel from Alice to Bob, and W is the channel from Bob to Alice. The maximum is over all probability distributions P and Q on the input alphabets of V and W respectively. We also prove a strong converse which establishes the above rate as the highest attainable in this situation.  </abstract>::line_number::3",816,false

In musical applications, this reconstruction should be perceptually accurate, and the parameterization should allow for such desirable signal modifications as time-scaling, pitch-shifting, and cross-synthesis; the analysis parameters should correspond to a signal model that is flexible enough to allow these transformations. Sinusoidal modeling meets this flexibility requirement, but has difficulty representing some salient features of musical signals such as attack transients and noiselike processes. In this paper, sinusoidal modeling is reviewed and some variations are proposed to account for its shortcomings; also, wavelet-based representations of musical signals are considered.  </abstract>::line_number::3",817,false

We present a formal model for concurrent systems. The model represents synchronous and asynchronous components in a uniform framework that supports compositional (assume-guarantee) and hierarchical (stepwise-refinement) design and verification. While synchronous models are based on a notion of atomic computation step, and asynchronous models remove that notion by introducing stuttering, our model is based on a flexible notion of what constitutes a computation step: by applying an abstraction operator to a system, arbitrarily many consecutive steps can be collapsed into a single step. The abstraction operator, which may turn an asynchronous system into a synchronous one, allows us to describe systems at various levels of temporal detail. For describing systems at various levels of spatial detail, we use a hiding operator that may turn a synchronous system into an asynchronous one. We illustrate the model with diverse examples from synchronous circuits, asynchronous shared-memory programs, and synchronous message-passing protocols.  </abstract>::line_number::2",818,false

These channels have memory due to the Markov channel variation. We obtain the FSMC capacity as a function of the conditional channel state probability. We also show that for i.i.d. channel inputs, this conditional probability converges weakly, and the channel's mutual information is then a closed-form continuous function of the input distribution. We next consider coding for FSMCs. In general, the complexity of maximum-likelihood decoding grows exponentially with the channel memory length. Therefore, in practice, interleaving and memoryless channel codes are used. This technique results in some performance loss relative to the inherent capacity of channels with memory. We propose a maximum-likelihood decision-feedback decoder with complexity that is independent of the channel memory. We calculate the capacity and cutoff rate of our technique, and show that it preserves the capacity of certain FSMCs. We also compare the performance of the decision-feedback decoder with that of interleaving and memoryless channel coding on a fading channel with 4PSK modulation.  </abstract>::line_number::2",819,false

Hybrid automata model systems with both digital and analog components, such as embedded control programs. Many verification tasks for such programs can be expressed as reachability problems for hybrid automata. By improving on previous decidability and undecidability results, we identify the precise boundary between decidability and undecidability of the reachability problem for hybrid automata. On the positive side, we give an (optimal) PSPACE reachability algorithm for the case of initialized rectangular automata, where all analog variables follow trajectories within piecewise-linear envelopes and are reinitialized whenever the envelope changes. Our algorithm is based on a translation of an initialized rectangular automaton into a timed automaton that defines the same timed language. The translation has practical significance for verification, because it guarantees the termination of symbolic procedures for the reachability analysis of initialized rectangular automata. On the negative side, we show that several slight generalizations of initialized rectangular automata lead to an undecidable reachability problem. In particular, we prove that the reachability problem is undecidable for timed automata with a single stopwatch.  </abstract>::line_number::2",820,false

Decisions of when and where to cache information are made without the benefit of the server's global knowledge of the usage patterns. In this paper, we present a new caching strategy: geographical push-caching. Using the server's global knowledge and a derived network topology, we distribute data to cooperating servers. The World Wide Web is an example of a wide-area system that will benefit from distance-sensitive caching, and we present an architecture that allows a Web server to autonomously replicate HTML pages. We use a trace-driven simulation to evaluate several competing caching strategies. Our results show that geographical push-caching reduces bandwidth consumption and sever load by the same amount as web proxy caching, but with a savings in global cache space of almost two orders of magnitude. More importantly, servers that wish to reduce Internet bandwidth consumption and their load can do so without waiting for web proxies to be implemented world-wide. Furthermore, geographical push-caching helps distribute server load for all web servers, not just the most popular as is the case with proxy caching.  </abstract>::line_number::5",821,false

The paper evaluates and models the three aspects of the communication performance: scheduling overhead, message-passing time, and synchronization overhead. Performance models are developed for the basic communication patterns, enabling the estimation of the communication times of a message-passing application. Such estimates facilitate activities such as application tuning, selection of the best available implementation technique, and performance comparisons among different multicomputers.  </abstract>::line_number::6",822,false

While recent advances have broadened the scope for which the optimal approach is applicable, this approach increasingly suffers from large execution times. In this paper, we propose a more efficient formulation of the modulo scheduling space that significantly decreases the execution time of solvers based on integer linear programs. For example, the total execution time is reduced by a factor of 8.6 when 782 loops from the Perfect Club, SPEC, and Livermore Fortran Kernels are scheduled for minimum register requirements using the more efficient formulation instead of the traditional formulation. Experimental evidence further indicates that significantly larger loops can be scheduled under realistic machine constraints.  </abstract>::line_number::5",823,false

However, other effects caused by illumination pose and specularity on three-dimensional object surfaces have not received notable attention. We present a chromaticity recognition method that discounts the effects of illumination pose, illumination color and specularity. It utilizes a chromaticity space based on log-ratio of sensor responses for illumination pose and color invariance. A model-based specularity detection/rejection algorithm can be used to improve the chromaticity recognition and illumination estimation for objects including specular reflections.  </abstract>::line_number::5",824,false

Central to the success of these services is the support for secure public key distribution. Although there are several existing services available for this purpose, they are not very scalable, either because they depend on a centralized server or rely on ad hoc trust relationships. In this paper, we present and examine a flexible approach to certificate distribution scalable to arbitrarily large networks. We propose a two level hierarchy where certificates can be independently authenticated by one or more peer authorities, called keyservers. Certificates for end-user and host entities are managed within local domains, called enterprises. By administering certificates close to the source, we reduce the load on the key servers and the effects of network topology changes. We describe the design of our system and present a preliminary performance analysis based on traces of present-day DNS requests.  </abstract>::line_number::6",825,false

This paper summarizes a progression of least commitment planners, starting with one that handles the sim ple strips representation, and ending with one that manages actions with disjunctive precondition, conditional effects and universal quantification over dynamic universes. Along the way we explain how Chapman's formulation of the Modal Truth Criterion is misleading and why his NP-completeness result for reasoning about plans with conditional effects does not apply to our planner.  </abstract>::line_number::6",826,false

However, conventional database systems do not provide the performance levels or response time guarantees needed by real-time applications. To address the need for high-performance real-time database systems, we propose to design, implement, and evaluate an object-oriented software system called Multiprocessor Database Architecture for Real-Time Systems (MDARTS). An important feature of MDARTS is that it supports explicit specification of real-time requirements and semantic constraints at an object-granularity level. The database examines these specifications at runtime during application initialization and dynamically adjusts its data management strategy accordingly to provide hard real-time guarantees. For maximum performance on shared-memory multiprocessors, MDARTS supports concurrent, direct, shared-memory data access. Prior real-time database systems do not support per-object dynamic configuration during initialization, and they either work only on uniprocessors or use relatively slow inter-process communication for all transactions. The unique design of MDARTS will support a transaction execution time two to three orders of magnitude faster than current real-time database systems for multiprocessors. For data access with less stringent timing constraints, MDARTS also supports remote transactions across networks and provides interfaces to external database systems. Once we have implemented the basic MDARTS architecture, we will demonstrate its capabilities by using it to develop distributed, open architecture controllers for actual manufacturing machine tools.  </abstract>::line_number::4",828,false

Internet routing instability, or the rapid fluctuation of network reach-ability information, is an important problem currently facing the Internet engineering community. High levels of network instability can lead to packet loss, increased network latency and time to convergence. At the extreme, high levels of routing instability have lead to the loss of internal connectivity in wide-area, national networks. In this paper, we describe several unexpected trends in routing instability, and examine a number of anomalies and pathologies observed in the exchange of inter-domain routing information. The analysis in this paper is based on data collected from BGP routing messages generated by border routers at five of the Internet core's public exchange points during a nine month period. We show that the volume of these routing updates is several orders of magnitude more than expected and that the majority of this routing information is redundant, or pathological. Furthermore, our analysis reveals several unexpected trends and ill-behaved systematic properties in Internet routing. We finally posit a number of explanations for these anomalies and evaluate their potential impact on the Internet infrastructure.  </abstract>::line_number::5",829,false

Increasingly sophisticated techniques are being developed to improve performance and functionality of recovery protocols. To better understand and analyze recovery schemes, we reexamine the concept of spheres of control [Dav78], using it as a unifying framework for specifying diverse recovery models simply and precisely. We constrain sphere-of-control formulations appropriately to capture transaction-oriented recovery in both centralized and distributed environments and with different types of schedules, as well as semantics-based recovery and compensation. In addition, we discuss how the operational semantics methodology of evolving algebras [Gur95] can model spheres of control formally and refine them to lower levels of abstraction.  </abstract>::line_number::5",830,false

We define heterogeneity both in resource types, e.g., CPU, and in scheduling policies, e.g., rate-monotonic scheduling. This analysis technique is one phase of our systems integration framework for designing large-scale, heterogeneous, distributed real-time systems whose timing properties can be strictly controlled and analyzed. This approach, denoted the Distributed Pipelining Framework, exploits the natural pipelining execution pattern found in a large number of continuous (periodic) applications executing over heterogenous resources. A teleconference application is used in this paper to show the utility of the approach.  </abstract>::line_number::5",831,false

In most of the architectures that have been proposed for this kind of agents, its behaviour is guided by its set of beliefs. In our work, rational agents are those systems that are permanently engaged in the process of rational inquiry; thus, their beliefs keep evolving in time, as a consequence of their internal inference procedures and their interaction with the environment. Both AI researchers and philosophers are interested in having a formal model of this process, and this is the main topic in our work. Beliefs have been formally modelled in the last decades using doxastic logics. The possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they seem to commit us to model agents that are logically omniscient and perfect reasoners. We avoid these problems by replacing possible worlds by conceivable situations, which are all the situations that the modelled agent is capable of considering. In this document we show how this notion of conceivable situations may be used to model the process of rational inquiry in which a non-ideal rational agent is engaged. We define a wide class of agents, called rational inquirers, which are a general abstraction of any kind of non-ideal agent. We show how the beliefs of these kind of agents evolve in time as a consequence of a multi-dimensional belief analysis, and we use the framework of conceivable situations in order to model this evolution.  </abstract>::line_number::5",832,false

It relieves the programmer from the task to provide a consistent treatment for every single special case that can occur. The programs that use the technique tend to be considerably smaller and more robust than those that do not use it.

The simple Bayesian classifier is known to be optimal when attributes are independent given the class, but the question of whether other sufficient conditions for its optimality exist has so far not been explored. Empirical results showing that it performs surprisingly well in many domains containing clear attribute dependences suggest that the answer to this question may be positive. This article shows that, although the Bayesian classifier's probability estimates are only optimal under quadratic loss if the independence assumption holds, the classifier itself can be optimal under zero-one loss (misclassification rate) even when this assumption is violated by a wide margin. The region of quadratic-loss optimality of the Bayesian classifier is in fact a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the region of zero-one optimality. This implies that the Bayesian classifier has a much greater range of applicability than previously thought. For example, in this article it is shown to be optimal for learning conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they violate the independence assumption. Further, studies in artificial domains show that it will often outperform more powerful classifiers for common training set sizes and numbers of attributes, even if its bias is a priori much less appropriate to the domain. This article's results also imply that detecting attribute dependence is not necessarily the best way to extend the Bayesian classifier, and this is also verified empirically.  </abstract>::line_number::9",835,false

We introduce a language model that predicts disfluencies probabilistically and uses an edited, fluent context to predict following words. The model is based on a generalization of the standard N-gram language model. It uses dynamic programming to compute the probability of a word sequence, taking into account possible hidden disfluency events. We analyze the model's performance for various disfluency types on the Switchboard corpus. We find that the model reduces word perplexity in the neighborhood of disfluency events; however, overall differences are small and have no significant impact on recognition accuracy. We also note that for modeling of the most frequent type of dis-fluency, filled pauses, a segmentation of utterances into linguistic (rather than acoustic) units is required. Our analysis illustrates a generally useful technique for language model evaluation based on local perplexity comparisons.  </abstract>::line_number::5",836,false

The features are one, two or three dimensional objects with regular outlines like a rectangle or a prism. The features could be parts of a map or image, an area of special interest for searching after oil, a sequence of ultra sound images, and so on. The storage medium is magnetic disk. The data are stored in chunks or blocks representing a regular part of the source object. We analyze the shape and the size to minimize the cost of retrieval. The optimization is based on minimum time to do retrieval. We have five combinations: Lines and areas from areas and volumes, and volumes from volumes. The optimal block sizes for random retrieval varies, with case, feature size and disk characteristics. One general observation is that longer disk tracks gives larger blocks. For line retrieval the optimal block size is only depending on disk track length. For other cases it is also depending on the feature size. For partly sequential retrieval the block size is not the actual block size used during retrieval, but the smallest addressing unit, and the optimal addressing unit could be rather small. The analysis reveals that using too small blocks could be very costly. The time could easily double or triple if small blocks are used. In many cases the optimal block size is several tracks.  </abstract>::line_number::5",839,false

The video servers should provide better functionality than most of today's video servers offer, - e.g., support of flexible and instant user interactions, delivery of multiple video formats and support of virtual video documents. In this paper we discuss the requirements that video servers should fulfill and we describe the design and implementation of the Elvira video server. The Elvira video server is built on a cluster of standard UNIX workstations interconnected by an ATM switch. The capacity of the Elvira server is evaluated and we show the effects of different strategies for allocation of video data across nodes and disks.  </abstract>::line_number::5",840,false

As the size of main memory increases, more of the database read requests will be satisfied from the buffer system, and the amount of disk write operations relative to disk read operations will increase. This calls for a focus on write optimized database systems. In this paper, we present solutions to this problem. We describe in detail the data structures and algorithms needed to realize a write optimized object-oriented database system in the context of Vagabond, an OODB currently being implemented at our department. In Vagabond, focus has been to provide support for applications which have earlier used file systems because of the limited data bandwidth in current database systems, typical examples are super computing applications and geographical information systems  </abstract>::line_number::5",841,false

However illumination effects, except shadows, are less noticeable on moving pictures. Shadows can be produced with the same techniques used for visibility computations, therefore the basic requirements of real-time rendering are transformations, pre-selection of the part of the scene to be displayed and visibility computations. Transformations scale well, ie, their time requirement grows linearly with the input size. Pre-selection, if implemented by the traditional way of polygon clipping, has a growing rate of N log N in the worst case, where N is the total number of edges in the scene. Visibility computations, exhibiting a quadratic growing rate, are the bottleneck from a theoretical point of view. Three approaches are discussed to speed up visibility computations: (i) reducing the expected running time to O(N log N ) (ii) using approximation algorithms with O(N K) worst-case time, where K is the linear resolution of the image, and (iii) applying parallel techniques leading to logarithmic time in the worst-case. Though the growing rate of the time requirement of pre-selection is significantly slower than that of visibility, it is demonstrated that pre-selection has to deal with a significantly higher amount of data than visibility computations, as the average clipping volume is 1/27 of the volume of the model.  </abstract>::line_number::3",842,false

We briefly trace the stages of the evolution of DataLab from a FORTRAN-IV system in 1973 to the current Java development. Description of this evolution allows us to discuss some key design and functionality decisions and issues that arose throughout the years; many of these issues remain topical, so, in addition to an evaluation of Java, we identify and discuss what are for us the major issues in the design of such software. Moreover, we address questions raised by the need to convert legacy systems, e.g. those programmed in C and various versions of FORTRAN. The experience of redesign and implementation in Java is described, together with a brief evaluation of the suitability of Java for 'number-crunching'. Overall conclusions are drawn, regarding design of such software, lessons learned, traps to avoid, and on Java itself.  </abstract>::line_number::10",843,false

A Multi-State Time Delay Neural Network performs the recognition of spelled letter sequences taking advantage of lip images from a standard camera. The problems addressed include efficient but effective representation of the visual information and optimum manner of combining the two modalities when rendering a decision. We show results for several alternatives to direct gray level image as the visual evidence. These are: Principal Components, Linear Discriminants, and DFT coefficients. Dimensionality of the input is decreased by a factor of 12 while maintaining recognition rates. Combination of the visual and acoustic information is performed at three different levels of abstraction. Results suggest that integration of higher order input features works best. On a continuous spelling task, visual-alone recognition of 45-55%, when combined with acoustic data, lowers audio-alone error rates by 30-40%.  </abstract>::line_number::6",845,false

The semantic analyzer of the spoken language system already in use at LIMSI makes use of a rule-based case grammar. In this work, the system of rules for the semantic analysis is replaced with a relatively simple, first order Hidden Markov Model. The performance of the two approaches can be compared because they use identical semantic representations despite their rather different methods for meaning extraction. We use an evaluation methodology that assesses performance at different semantic levels, including the database response comparison used in the ARPA ATIS paradigm.  </abstract>::line_number::5",846,false

A single (unknown) probability distribution over the domain is used to generate random examples for the learning algorithm and measure the speed at which the target changes. Clearly, the more rapidly the target moves, the harder it is for the algorithm to maintain a good approximation of the target. Therefore we evaluate algorithms based on how much movement of the target can be tolerated between examples while predicting with accuracy *. Furthermore, the complexity of the class H of possible targets, as measured by d, its VC-dimension, also effects the difficulty of tracking the target concept. We show that if the problem of minimizing the number of disagreements with a sample from among concepts in a class H can be approximated to within a factor k, then there is a simple tracking algorithm for H which can achieve a probability * of making a mistake if the target movement rate is at most a constant times * 2 =(k(d + k) ln 1 * ), where d is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of H. Also, we show that if H is properly PAC-learnable, then there is an efficient (randomized) algorithm that with high probability approximately minimizes disagreements to within a factor of 7d + 1, yielding an efficient tracking algorithm for H which tolerates drift rates up to a constant times * 2 =(d 2 ln 1 In addition, we prove complementary results for the classes of halfspaces and axis-aligned hy perrectangles showing that the maximum rate of drift that any algorithm (even with unlimited computational power) can tolerate is a constant times * 2 =d.  </abstract>::line_number::5",847,false

Feature selection is a problem of choosing a subset of relevant features. In general, only exhaustive search can bring about the optimal subset. With a monotonic measure, exhaustive search can be avoided without sacrificing optimality. Unfortunately, most error- or distance-based measures are not monotonic. A new measure is employed in this work that is monotonic and fast to compute. The search for relevant features according to this measure is guaranteed to be complete but not exhaustive. Experiments are conducted for verification.  </abstract>::line_number::9",848,false

This paper argues that this is because there has been no proper technique that enables us to do so. With an algorithm that can extract rules 1 , by drawing parallels with those of decision trees, we show that the predictions of a network can be explained via rules extracted from it, thereby, the network can be understood. Experiments demonstrate that rules extracted from neural networks are comparable with those of decision trees in terms of predictive accuracy, number of rules and average number of conditions for a rule; they preserve high predictive accuracy of original networks.  </abstract>::line_number::5",849,false

The environment should help trainees develop an understanding of the task being trained, and should provide guidance and assistance as needed. This paper describes a system for developing virtual environments in which pedagogical capabilities are incorporated into autonomous agents that interact with trainees. These pedagogical agents can monitor trainees progress and provide guidance and assistance. The agents interact with simulations of objects in the environment, and with trainees. The paper describes the architectural features of the environment and of the agents that permit the agents to meet instructional objectives within the virtual environment. It also discusses how agent-based instruction is combined with other methods of delivering instruction.  </abstract>::line_number::4",851,false

The availability of corpus-based statistical knowledge motivates the invention of a new style of generation in which word lattices compactly encode many possible sentence renderings and a statistical extractor chooses the best ones. The focus of generation thus shifts to how word lattices can be generated from abstract meaning representation. This paper presents a flexible meaning representation scheme and generation mechanism. It includes an efficient generation algorithm and grammar formalism that maps from a meaning representation to a lattice. This mapping is flexible enough to allow meaning representation along a continuum of semantic depth.  </abstract>::line_number::5",852,false

Our algorithm does not need to compute round-trip time (RTT) from all receivers to the source, nor does it require knowledge of group membership or network topology. Through simulations, we evaluate our algorithm with and without TCP cross traffic. This initial evaluation study shows that our algorithm takes advantage of network bandwidth when available, yet does not starve competing flows.  </abstract>::line_number::5",853,false

The key issue in their performance is efficient query planning that minimizes the number of information sources used to answer a query. Previous work on query planning has considered generating information gathering plans solely based on compile-time analysis of the query and the models of the information sources. We argue that at compile-time it may not be possible to generate an efficient plan for retrieving the requested information because of the large number of possibly relevant sources. We describe an approach that naturally extends query planning to use run-time information to optimize queries that involve many sources. First, we describe an algorithm for generating a discrimination matrix, which is a data structure that identifies the information that can be sensed at run-time to optimize a query plan. Next, we describe how the discrimination matrix is used to decide which of the possible run-time sensing actions to perform. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach yields significant savings (over 90% for some queries) in a real-world task.  </abstract>::line_number::6",855,false

But the problem of how to learn required semantic rules has not previously been solved. This paper describes an approach using an inductive learning algorithm to solve the problem. In our approach, learning is triggered by user queries and then the system induces semantic rules from the information in databases. The inductive learning algorithm used in this approach can select an appropriate set of relevant attributes from a potentially huge number of attributes in real-world databases. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach can learn sufficient background knowledge to reformulate queries and provide a 57 percent average performance improvement.  </abstract>::line_number::5",856,false

This paper describes an algorithm called D that does that combination. The idea is to represent the states of the learned model using observable symbols as well as hidden symbols that are constructed during learning. These hidden symbols are created to reflect the distinct behaviors of the model states. The distinct behaviors are represented as local distinguishing experiments (LDEs) (not to be confused with global distinguishing sequences), and these LDEs are created when the learner's prediction mismatches the actual observation from the unknown machine. To synchronize the model with the environment, these LDEs can also be concatenated to form a homing sequence. It can be shown that D can learn, with probability 1 ~, a model that is an *-approximation of the unknown machine, in a number of actions polynomial in the size of the environment and  </abstract>::line_number::4",858,false

Accuracy in this agent tracking task is critically dependent on the accuracy of the tracker's (tracking agent's) model of the trackee (tracked agent). Unfortunately, in real-world situations, model imperfections arise due to the tracker's resource and information constraints, as well as due to trackees' dynamic behavior modification. While such model imperfections are unavoidable, a tracker must nonetheless attempt to be adaptive in its agent tracking. This article identifies key issues in adaptive agent tracking and presents an approach called DEFT. At its core, DEFT is based on discrimination-based learning. The main idea is to identify the deficiency of a model based on tracking failures, and revise the model by using features that are critical in discriminating successful and failed tracking episodes. Because in real-world situations the set of candidate discriminating features is very large, DEFT relies on knowledge-based focusing to limit the discrimination to those features that it determines were relevant in successful tracking episodes with an autonomous explanation capability as a major source of this knowledge. This article reports on experiments with an implementation of key aspects of DEFT in a complex synthetic air-to-air combat domain.  </abstract>::line_number::6",859,false

Machine learning presents a promising approach to this problem in the form of systems that automatically adapt their behavior to accommodate different users. In this paper, we present an empirical study of learning user models in an adaptive assistant for crisis scheduling. We describe the problem domain and the scheduling assistant, then present an initial formulation of the adaptive assistant's learning task and the results of a baseline study. After this, we report the results of three subsequent experiments that investigate the effects of problem reformulation and representation augmentation. The results suggest that problem reformulation leads to significantly better accuracy without sacrificing the usefulness of the learned behavior. The studies also raise several interesting issues in adaptive assistance for scheduling.  </abstract>::line_number::6",860,false

In this paper, we argue that this purely reactive strategy is only optimal if sensing is inexpensive, and we formulate a simple model of execution that incorporates the cost of sensing. We present an average-case analysis of this model, which shows that in domains with high sensing cost or low probability of error, a more `automatic' strategy - one with long intervals between sensing can lead to less expensive execution. The analysis also shows that the distance to the goal has no effect on the optimal sensing interval. These results run counter to the prevailing wisdom in the planning community, but they promise a more balanced approach to the interleaving of execution and sensing.  </abstract>::line_number::8",861,false

In particular, there is the need to coordinate transactions at different security levels avoiding both potential timing covert channels and the starvation of transactions at higher security levels. Suppose a transaction at a lower security level attempts to write a data item that is being read by a transaction at a higher security level. On the one hand, a timing covert channel arises if the transaction at the lower security level is either delayed or aborted by the scheduler. On the other hand, the transaction at the high security level may be subjected to an indefinite delay if it is forced to abort repeatedly. This paper extends the classical two-phase locking mechanism to multilevel secure file systems. The scheme presented here prevents potential timing covert channels and avoids the abort of higher level transactions nonetheless guaranteeing serializability. The programmer is provided with a powerful set of linguistic constructs that supports exception handling, partial rollback and forward recovery. The proper use of these constructs can prevent the indefinite delay in completion of a higher level transaction, and allows the programmer to trade off starvation with transaction isolation.  </abstract>::line_number::2",863,false

This color clustering produces for each image a small set of representative colors which captures the color properties of the image, and a small set of sizable contiguous regions which captures the spatial/geometrical properties of the image. The proposed method outperforms the traditional histogram and its improved methods not only with its richer image retrieval capabilities which cover a wider spectrum of user requirements, but also with its powerful indexing scheme which is essential to cater for large scale image databases.  </abstract>::line_number::5",864,false

The ROBBIE 1 system uses introspective reasoning to monitor the retrieval process of a case-based planner to detect retrieval of inappropriate cases. When retrieval problems are detected, the source of the problems is explained and the explanations are used to determine new indices to use during future case retrieval. The goal of ROBBIE's learning is to increase its ability to focus retrieval on relevant cases, with the aim of simultaneously decreasing the number of candidates to consider and increasing the likelihood that the system will be able to successfully adapt the retrieved cases to fit the current situation. We evaluate the benefits of the approach in light of empirical results examining the effects of index learning in the ROBBIE system.  </abstract>::line_number::8",865,false

The main result proved is an analog of one proved for the continuous time case by the authors, and shows that such stabilization is possible if and only if the system is stabilizable with arbitrary controls and the transition matrix has spectral radius less or equal to one. The proof provides in principle an algorithm for the construction of such feedback laws, which can be implemented either as cascades or as parallel connections (single hidden layer neural networks) of simple saturation functions.  </abstract>::line_number::13",868,false

The key, consisting of two blocks, K 1 and K 2 is used in the following way: The message block is XORed with K 1 before applying F , and the outcome is XORed with K 2 , to produce the cryptogram block. We show that the resulting cipher is secure (when the permutation is random or pseudorandom). This removes the need to store, or generate a multitude of permutations.  </abstract>::line_number::2",869,false

Traditional decision theory has assumed that agents have complete, consistent and readily available beliefs and preferences. Obviously, even if an expert system has complete and consistent beliefs, it cannot have them readily available. Moreover, some beliefs about beliefs are not even approximately computable. It is shown that if all players have complete and consistent beliefs, they can compute approximate beliefs about beliefs of any order by considering events arbitrarily close in some well-defined sense to the ones in question.  </abstract>::line_number::2",870,false

The subject of this paper is finding small sample spaces for joint distributions of n discrete random variables. Such distributions are often only required to obey a certain limited set of constraints of the form P r(E) = . We show that the problem of deciding whether there exists any distribution satisfying a given set of constraints is NP-hard. However, if the constraints are consistent, then there exists a distribution satisfying them which is supported by a small sample space (one whose cardinality is equal to the number of constraints). For the important case of independence constraints, where the constraints have a certain form and are consistent with a joint distribution of n independent random variables, a small sample space can be constructed in polynomial time. This last result is also useful for de-randomizing algorithms. We demonstrate this technique by an application to the problem of finding large independent sets in sparse hypergraphs.  </abstract>::line_number::5",871,false

A bipolar intensity approach enables a linear summation of interference fringes, a factor of two speed increase, and the elimination of image noise caused by object self-interference. An order of magnitude speed increase is obtained through the use of precomputed look-up tables containing a large array of elemental interference patterns corresponding to point source contributions from each of the possible locations in image space. Results achieved using a data-parallel supercomputer to compute horizontal-parallax-only holographic patterns containing 6 megasamples indicate that an image comprised of 10,000 points with arbitrary brightness (grayscale) can be computed in under one second.  </abstract>::line_number::5",872,false

This problem is exacerbated if the data to be presented by the system is speech, rather than text or graphics, because of the slow and serial nature of speech.

The method used allows for the creation of dynamically determined representations that are not pre-designed by the human creator of the system. In an illustrative path-planning problem, evolved programs learn a model of their world and use this internal representation to plan their successive actions. The results show that the proposed method is successful in evolving programs that solve the planning problem and is thus a worthy basis for further investigation.  </abstract>::line_number::5",874,false

A replica-symmetric solution is found to be stable for all but small amounts of noise.

One key problem is how to assign weights to attributes of cases. Although several weighting methods have been proposed, some methods cannot handle numeric attributes directly, so it is necessary to discretize numeric values by classification. Furthermore, existing methods have no theoretical background, so little can be said about optimality. We propose a new weighting method based on a statistical technique called Quantification Method II. It can handle both numeric and symbolic attributes in the same framework. Generated attribute weights are optimal in the sense that they maximize the ratio of variance between classes to variance of all cases. Experiments on several benchmark tests show that in many cases, our method obtains higher accuracies than some other weighting methods. The results also indicate that it can distinguish relevant attributes from irrelevant ones, and can tolerate noisy data.  </abstract>::line_number::5",878,false

This paper presents a comparative study of several methods for estimating the true error of treestructured regression models. We evaluate these methods in the context of regression tree pruning. Pruning is considered a key issue for obtaining reliable treestructured models in a real world scenario. The major step of a pruning process consists of obtaining accurate estimates of the error of alternative tree models. We evaluate experimentally four methods for obtaining these estimates in twelve domains. The goal of this evaluation was to characterise the performance of the methods in the task of selecting the best possible tree among the set of trees considered during pruning. The results of the comparison show that certain estimators lead to poor decisions in some domains. The Cross Validation variant that we have proposed achieved the best results on the setups we have considered.  </abstract>::line_number::7",879,false

This paper describes the work on methods for combining rules obtained by machine learning systems. Three methods for obtaining the classification of examples with those rules are compared. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed and the results obtained on three real world domains are commented. The methods compared are: selection of the best rule; PROSPECTOR-like probabilistic approximation for rule combination; and MYCIN-like approximation. Results show significant differences between methods indicating that the problemsolving strategy is important for accuracy of learning systems.  </abstract>::line_number::6",880,false

By encoding grammatical strings as temporal sequences, recurrent neural networks can be trained to behave like deterministic sequential finite-state automata. Algorithms have been developed for extracting grammatical rules from trained networks. Using a simple method for inserting prior knowledge (or rules) into recurrent neural networks, we show that recurrent neural networks are able to perform rule revision. Rule revision is performed by comparing the inserted rules with the rules in the finite-state automata extracted from trained networks. The results from training a recurrent neural network to recognize a known non-trivial, randomly generated regular grammar show that not only do the networks preserve correct rules but that they are able to correct through training inserted rules which were initially incorrect. (By incorrect, we mean that the rules were not the ones in the randomly generated grammar.)  </abstract>::line_number::8",881,false

NARX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive models with eXogenous inputs) neural network models are a popular subclass of recurrent networks and have been used in many applications. Though embedded memory can be found in all recurrent network models, it is particularly prominent in NARX models. We show that using intelligent memory order selection through pruning and good initial heuristics significantly improves the generalization and predictive performance of these nonlinear systems on problems as diverse as grammatical inference and time series prediction.  </abstract>::line_number::8",882,false

Using a task with known optimal training error, and a pre-specified maximum number of training updates, we investigate the convergence of the backpropagation algorithm with respect to a) the complexity of the required function approximation, b) the size of the network in relation to the size required for an optimal solution, and c) the degree of noise in the training data. In general, for a) the solution found is worse when the function to be approximated is more complex, for b) oversized networks can result in lower training and generalization error in certain cases, and for c) the use of committee or ensemble techniques can be more beneficial as the level of noise in the training data is increased. For the experiments we performed, we do not obtain the optimal solution in any case. We further support the observation that larger networks can produce better training and generalization error using a face recognition example where a network with many more parameters than training points generalizes better than smaller networks.  </abstract>::line_number::12",883,false

Meta search engines have been introduced which address some of these and other difficulties in searching the WWW. However, current meta search engines retain some of these difficulties and may also introduce their own problems (e.g. reduced relevance because one or more of the search engines returns results with poor relevance). We present Inquirus, the NECI meta search engine, which addresses many of the deficiencies in current techniques. Rather than working with the list of documents and summaries returned by search engines, as current meta search engines typically do, the Inquirus meta search engine works by downloading and analyzing the individual documents. The Inquirus meta search engine makes improvements over existing search engines in a number of areas, e.g.: more useful document summaries incorporating query term context, identification of both pages which no longer exist and pages which no longer contain the query terms, advanced detection of duplicate pages, improved document ranking using proximity information, dramatically improved precision for certain queries by using specific expressive forms, and quick jump links and highlighting when viewing the full documents.   </abstract>::line_number::6",884,false

Generally, there is an additional cost to compute the transform itself. Our observation is motivated by recent activity in wavelet and subband decompositions and related spectral analyses, which are attractive alternatives for signal compression applications. A natural question when using such techniques is to determine if convolutions of N -point signals can be calculated with fewer operations in a compressed transform domain than in an uncompressed time domain. The answer is negative for a broad set of assumptions. This paper indicates what assumptions must be relaxed in seeking a linear transform that has a convolution theorem comparable to the convolution theorem for fourier transforms.  </abstract>::line_number::6",885,false

We show that these formulations are also an important tool in the design of approximation algorithms with good worst-case performance guarantees. We give simple new rounding techniques to convert an optimal fractional solution into a feasible schedule for which we can prove a constant-factor performance guarantee, thereby giving the first theoretical evidence of the strength of these relaxations. Specifically, we consider the problem of minimizing the total weighted job completion time on a single machine subject to precedence constraints, and give a polynomial-time (4 + *)-approximation algorithm, for any * &gt; 0; the best previously known guarantee for this problem was superlogarithmic. With somewhat larger constants, we also show how to extend this result to the case with release date constraints, and still more generally, to the case with m identical parallel machines. We give two other techniques for problems in which there are release dates, but no precedence constraints: the first is based on other new LP rounding algorithms, whereas the second is a general framework for designing on-line algorithms to minimize the total weighted completion time.  </abstract>::line_number::3",886,false

Two different constraint dynamical systems representing this dynamics have been described recently; the relation of these two systems is investigated. The symmetry groups of both systems are found. The systems are reduced to the presymplectic manifolds 1 and 2 , lest non-physical aspects like gauge fixings or embeddings in extended phase spaces hinder the argument. The following facts are shown. 1 is three- and 2 is five-dimensional; the description of the shell dynamics by 1 is incomplete so that some measurable properties of the shell cannot be predicted. 1 is locally equivalent to a subsystem of 2 and the corresponding local morphisms are not unique, due to the large symmetry group of 2 . The local equivalence explains why the same radial equation results from both systems; what is, however, the physical importance of just local, but not global equivalence of constraint dynamical systems remains unclear.  </abstract>::line_number::6",888,false

We report on the potential of these techniques, as well as on the typical accuracies of these techniques in the retrieval of the cloud and aerosol extinction and backscatter vertical profiles in the troposphere (0-7 km ASL).  </abstract>::line_number::5",889,false

Their development, however, is not yet supported by a sound technological and methodological background, as the results developed for small size distributed systems often do not scale up. Recently, mobile code languages (MCLs) have been proposed as a technological answer to the problem. In this work, we abstract away from the details of these languages by deriving design paradigms exploiting code mobility that are independent of any particular technology. We present such design paradigms, together with a discussion of their features, their application domain, and some hints about the selection of the correct paradigm for a given distributed application.  </abstract>::line_number::16",890,false

These simulations include dynamical processes in thalamo-cortical loops which are used to generate short-term persistent responses in prefrontal cortex. We discuss this model in terms of the representation of input stimuli in cortical association areas and prefrontal short-term memory areas. We report on interference phenomena that result from the interaction of these dynamical processes and lateral projections within cortical columns. These interference phenomena can be used to elucidate the representational organization of short-term memory.  </abstract>::line_number::6",891,false

The paper focuses on dynamic uniformity, which differs from the classical problems in that processes continually leave and join the ongoing computation. Here, we first treat a static version of the problem (lacking joins), and then extend the results so obtained to also include joins. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to Consensus, which cannot be solved in asynchronous systems with even a single faulty process, dynamic uniformity can be solved using a failure detection mechanism that makes bounded numbers of mistakes. Because dynamic uniformity arises in systems that maintain safety within a primary partition of a network, our paper provides a rigorous characterization of the framework upon which several existing distributed programming environments are based.  </abstract>::line_number::4",892,false

Our main result is a proof that such algorithms are boosting algorithms. By this we mean that if the functions that label the internal nodes of the decision tree can weakly approximate the unknown target function, then the top-down algorithms we study will amplify this weak advantage to build a tree achieving any desired level of accuracy. The bounds we obtain for this amplification show an interesting dependence on the splitting criterion used by the top-down algorithm. More precisely, if the functions used to label the internal nodes have error 1=2  as approximations to the target function, then for the splitting criteria used by CART and C4.5, trees of size (1=*) O(1= 2 * 2 ) and (1=*) O(log(1=*)= 2 ) (respectively) suffice to drive the error below *. Thus (for example), a small constant advantage over random guessing is amplified to any larger constant advantage with trees of constant size. For a new splitting criterion suggested by our analysis, the much stronger bound of (1=*) O(1= 2 ) (which is polynomial in 1=*) is obtained, which is provably optimal for decision tree algorithms. The differing bounds have a natural explanation in terms of concavity properties of the splitting criterion. The primary contribution of this work is in proving that some popular and empirically successful heuristics that are based on first principles meet the criteria of an independently motivated theoretical model.  </abstract>::line_number::6",893,false

We provide a unified framework for parameter estimation that encompasses both on-line learning, where the model is continuously adapted to new data cases as they arrive, and the more traditional batch learning, where a pre-accumulated set of samples is used in a one-time model selection process. In the batch case, our framework encompasses both the gradient projection algorithm [2, 3] and the EM algorithm [14] for Bayesian networks. The framework also leads to new on-line and batch parameter update schemes, including a parameterized version of EM. We provide both empirical and theoretical results indicating that parameterized EM allows faster convergence to the maximum likelihood parame ters than does standard EM.  </abstract>::line_number::10",894,false

However, many computer systems cannot make use of the available bandwidth because of the high overhead associated with network communication. In this paper we review the operations involved in communication over high-speed networks, and we describe optimizations of the network interface that improve network throughput. We also discuss how the payoff of the optimizations is influenced by features of the host software and architecture. This paper is based on our experience with the interfaces for the Nectar and Gigabit Nectar networks.  </abstract>::line_number::4",895,false

The characterization of good primary effects, however, has remained at an informal level and there have been no algorithms for selecting primary effects of operators. We formalize the use of primary effects in planning and present a criterion for selecting useful primary effects, which guarantees efficiency and completeness. We analyze the efficiency of planning with primary effects and the quality of the resulting plans. We then describe a learning algorithm that automatically selects primary effects and demonstrate, both analytically and empirically, that the use of this algorithm significantly reduces planning time and does not compromise completeness.  </abstract>::line_number::11",896,false

In previous works, assumptions were made as to the existence of enough dynamic coupling between the active and the passive joints of the manipulator for it to be possible to control the position of the passive joints via the dynamic coupling. In this work, the authors aim to develop an index to measure the dynamic coupling, so as to address when control of the underactuated system is possible, and how the motion and robot configuration can be designed.

S !ffi&&gt; enhances the representation of Church's simply typed -calculus as abstract Bohm trees by enforcing extensionality and by incorporating linear constructs. This approach permits procedures such as unification to retain the efficient head access that characterizes first-order term languages without the overhead of performing -conversions at run time. Potential applications lie in proof search, logic programming, and logical frameworks based on linear type theories. We define the spine calculus, give translations of !ffi&&gt; into S !ffi&&gt; and vice-versa, prove their soundness and completeness with respect to typing and reductions, and show that the spine calculus is strongly normalizing and admits unique canonical forms.  </abstract>::line_number::6",899,false

Alignment tolerances of 0.05 mm to 0.1 mm are sufficient to register the vertical connection pads or vias on each layer. More aggressive designs of the future will, however, require manufacturing accuracies of at least an order of magnitude better to accommodate much finer wire widths and pin spacings. Conventional equipment relying on mechanical pin-in-slot methods will likely be inadequate, and a new approach will be needed. We describe here a sensor-based approach for registration and stacking of electronic substrate sublaminates that replaces pin-in-slot methods, yet does not require accurate automation equipment. A pilot work cell for this approach is presented, which has an IBM 7576 coarse-positioning robot, a specially-developed fine-positioning robot, optical sensors, and several routine low accuracy fixtures. A novel robot bracing method was used to minimize environmental vibration during sublaminate stacking. Pairs of test sublaminates, each containing an identical pattern of 100 m holes, were aligned, stacked and bonded. The accuracy of registration  </abstract>::line_number::4",900,false

By tapping in to the users wealth of experience with contact transitions, compliance, uncertainty and operations sequencing, we hope to provide a more intuitive programming environment for complex, real-world tasks based on the expressiveness of non-verbal communication. A requirement for this to be accomplished is the ability to interpret gestures to infer the intentions behind them. As a first step toward this goal, this paper presents an application of distributed perception for inferring a users intentions by observing tactile gestures. These gestures consist of sparse, inexact, physical nudges applied to the robots end effector for the purpose of modifying its trajectory in free space. A set of independent agents - each with its own local, fuzzified, heuristic model of a particular trajectory parameter - observes data from a wrist force/torque sensor to evaluate the gestures. The agents then independently determine the confidence of their respective findings and distributed arbitration resolves the interpretation through voting.  </abstract>::line_number::5",901,false

A high-resolution (0.5m grid spacing) digital elevation map (DEM) has been constructed using a helicopter-based laser range-finder. Object locations are estimated by intersecting viewing rays from a calibrated sensor platform with the DEM. Continuous object trajectories can then be assembled from sequences of single-frame location estimates using spatio-temporal filtering and domain knowledge.  </abstract>::line_number::5",903,false

Run-time code generation can make use of values and invariants that cannot be exploited at compile time, yielding code that is superior to statically optimal code. But the cost of optimizing and generating code at run time can be prohibitive. We demonstrate how compile-time specialization can reduce the cost of run-time code generation by an order of magnitude without greatly affecting code quality. Several benchmark programs are examined, which exhibit an average cost of six cycles per instruction generated at run time.  </abstract>::line_number::6",904,false

The interface specification of a procedure describes the procedure's behavior using pre- and postconditions. These pre- and postconditions are written using various functions. If some of these functions are partial, or underspec-ified, then the procedure specification may not be well-defined. We show how to write pre- and postcondition specifications that avoid such problems, by having the precondition protect the postcondition from the effects of partiality and underspecification. We formalize the notion of protection from partiality in the context of specification languages like VDM-SL and COLD-K. We also formalize the notion of protection from underspecification for the Larch family of specification languages, and for Larch show how one can prove that a procedure specification is protected from the effects of underspecification.  </abstract>::line_number::7",905,false

Each of these is appropriate for some classes of problems, but none is suitable for all problems. How, then, does a software designer choose an architecture suitable for the problem at hand? Two kinds of information are required: (1)  careful discrimination among the candidate architectures and (2)  design guidance on how to make appropriate choices. Here we support  careful discrimination with a preliminary classification of styles. We use a two-dimensional classification strategy with control and data issues as the dominant organizing axes. We position the major styles within this space and use finer-grained discriminations to elaborate variations on the styles. This provides a framework for organizing  design guidance , which we partially flesh out with rules of thumb.  </abstract>::line_number::5",906,false

The first, an impact control strategy, involves adding torques to the joints of the redundant manipulator to impede motion into the environment with which it is colliding. The second, an impact planning strategy, involves choosing the configuration best suited for minimizing the impact force from an impact event, the approximate location of which is known ahead of time. Simulated results from both strategies are presented and discussed, and it is shown that both are successful in minimizing the impact force resulting from planned and unplanned collisions.  </abstract>::line_number::4",908,false

The techniques provided in this thesis will allow nonprogrammers to create a new variety of complete, interactive applications including many board games and educational software using PBD. A PBD software tool uses inferencing to induce programs by watching the developer demonstrate examples that show how the application should behave. Current systems reduce their scope or resort to having the developer program because they do not provide sufficient ways to express behaviors and the factors that affect them. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to develop understandable forms of annotated expression and manipulation that help a system infer a broader range of behavior. To test these ideas, this proposal introduces a new system called Gamut that will present the techniques in a unified software tool. The first technique replaces the macro recorder method for demonstrating behavior used in other PBD systems with a technique called nudges. The developer demonstrates by correcting the system at important points during program execution and also using two nudge commands to communicate important situations. First, the Do Something! nudge causes the system to reconsider past learned behavior and try to generalize its knowledge to fit the current situation. Using the Stop That! nudge will point out improper behavior and generate negative examples. Second, Gamut will use a new deck-of-playing-cards metaphor to express concepts such as randomness, sequencing, and data storage. By constructing an appropriate deck, shufing, sorting, and playing cards at key moments, developers can incorporate many effects not available without programming in other systems. Third, Gamut will improve communication about behaviors by making them more manipulable than in previous systems. Behaviors will be represented as small icons near the objects they affect. Using the familiar cut, copy, and paste commands, the developer can transfer behavior between objects. Determining how to make a behavior operate in the new context will be inferred automatically. An objects state from the recent past will be represented as temporal ghosts in which objects become dimmed, translucent images. Many sorts of behavior refer to prior states such as a previous position or an old property value. The ghost objects will allow the developer to make explicit connections. Finally, to reduce the number of options the system must explore, the developer will be able to give hints by highlighting important objects and properties. A new inferencing algorithm will be created that will take advantage of the hints. By combining these techniques, Gamut will provide a rich medium for expressing developer intentions, fostering greater communication between the PBD system and the developer and enabling the developer to create highly interactive software with minimal programming expertise.  </abstract>::line_number::4",910,false

The new model is conceptually simpler, and more naturally suited to modeling whole-sentence phenomena, than the conditional ME models proposed to date. By avoiding the chain rule, the model treats each sentence or utterance as a bag of features, where features are arbitrary computable properties of the sentence. The model is unnor-malizable, but this does not interfere with training (done via sampling) or with use. Using the model is computationally straightforward. The main computational cost of training the model is in generating sample sentences from a Gibbs distribution. Interestingly, this cost has different dependencies, and is potentially lower, than in the comparable conditional ME model.  </abstract>::line_number::4",911,false

Although the provision of coherent caches in many recent machines has alleviated the problem somewhat, cache misses still occur frequently enough that they significantly lower performance. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of non-binding software-controlled prefetching, as proposed in the Stanford DASH Multiprocessor, to address this problem. The prefetches are non-binding in the sense that the prefetched data is brought to a cache close to the processor, but is still available to the cache coherence protocol to keep it consistent. Prefetching is software-controlled since the program must explicitly issue prefetch instructions. The paper presents results from detailed simulation studies done in the context of the Stanford DASH multiprocessor. Our results show that for applications with regular data access patterns|we evaluate a particle-based simulator used in aeronautics and an LU-decomposition application|prefetching can be very effective. It was easy to augment the applications to do prefetching and it increased their performance by 100-150% when we prefetched directly into the processor's cache. However, for applications with complex data usage patterns, prefetching was less successful. After much effort, the performance of a distributed-time logic simulation application that made extensive use of pointers and linked lists could be increased only by 30%. The paper also evaluates the effects of various hardware optimizations such as separate prefetch issue buffers, prefetching with exclusive ownership, lockup-free caches, and weaker memory consistency models on the performance of prefetching.  </abstract>::line_number::4",913,false

Unfortunately, the information provided by the state-of-the-art cache miss profiling technique (summary profiling) is inadequate for references with intermediate miss ratios|it results in either failing to hide latency, or else inserting unnecessary overhead. To overcome this problem, we propose and evaluate a new technique| correlation profiling|which improves predictability by correlating the caching behavior with the associated dynamic context. Our experimental results demonstrate that roughly half of the 22 non-numeric applications we study can potentially enjoy significant reductions in memory stall time by exploiting at least one of the three forms of correlation profiling we consider.  </abstract>::line_number::5",914,false

Research on mobile robot navigation has produced two major paradigms for mapping indoor environments: grid-based and topological. While grid-based methods produce accurate metric maps, their complexity often prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in large-scale indoor environments. Topological maps, on the other hand, can be used much more efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological maps are often difficult to learn and maintain in large-scale environments, particularly if momentary sensor data is highly ambiguous. This paper describes an approach that integrates both paradigms: grid-based and topological. Grid-based maps are learned using artificial neural networks and naive Bayesian integration. Topological maps are generated on top of the grid-based maps, by partitioning the latter into coherent regions. By combining both paradigms, the approach presented here gains advantages from both worlds: accuracy/consistency and efficiency. The paper gives results for autonomous exploration, mapping and operation of a mobile robot in populated multi-room environments.  </abstract>::line_number::4",915,false

Instead of using Gibbs sampling or other Markov Chain schemes that rely on full conditional distributions, we propose and investigate a method for simulating from posterior distributions based on rejection sampling. The method applies with arbitrary prior distributions but we also employ as a default reference prior a version of Jeffreys's prior based on the integrated (restricted) likelihood. We demonstrate the ease of application and flexibility of this approach in several familiar settings, even in the presence of unbalanced data. A program implementing the algorithm discussed here will be available in the SAS MIXED procedure.  </abstract>::line_number::8",917,false

Such data sets are common in spatial-temporal analysis and image analysis. This scheme combines backfitting algorithm with iterative imputation algorithm in order to save both computational space and time. The convergence of this algorithm and various ways to further speed it up, such as collapsing component functions and successive over-relaxation, are discussed. Issues related to its application in spatial-temporal analysis are discussed too. An application to a global analysis of historical surface temperature data is described.  </abstract>::line_number::3",918,false

This study uncovers trading styles in the transaction records of US Treasury bond futures. It uses transaction-by-transaction data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions' (CFTC) Computerized Trade Reconstruction (CTR) records. The data set consists of 30 million transaction| the complete US T-bond futures market for 3 years. Each transaction record consists of time (by the minute), price, volume, buy/sell, and an identifier of the specific account. We use statistical clustering techniques to group together trades that are similar. Two sets of assumptions have to be made: (1) What is a trade? We define a trade to begin when an account opens a position, and to end when its position size returns to zero. We describe each trade by several trade-specific variables (e.g., length of trade, maximum position size, opening move, long or short) and several exogenous, market-specific variables (e.g., price, volatility, trading volume). (2) What process generated the data? We assume a mixture of Gaussians. An observed trade is interpreted as a noisy realization of one of the mixture components. This paper assumes identity covariance matrices. Furthermore, each trade is fully assigned to a single cluster. We compare this approach to diagonal and to full covariance structure with probabilistic assignments. Trade profit was held back in the clustering process. It turns out that the clusters differ significantly in their profit and risk characteristics. Using conditional distributions, we summarize features of profitable trading styles and contrast them with losing strategies. We find that profitable styles tend to hold trades longer, trade at higher volatility, and trade earlier in the contracts. We also show how some clusters uncover technical traders. Using the information about the individual accounts, the assignments of accounts to clusters are described by entropy, and the transitions of a given account through clusters is modeled by a first order Markov model.  </abstract>::line_number::6",919,false

A knowledge-level analysis of complex tasks like diagnosis and design can give us a better understanding of these tasks in terms of the goals they aim to achieve and the different ways to achieve these goals. In this paper we present a knowledge-level analysis of redesign. Redesign is viewed as a family of methods based on some common principles, and a number of dimensions along which redesign problem solving methods can vary are distinguished. By examining the problem-solving behavior of a number of existing redesign systems and approaches, we came up with a collection of problem-solving methods for redesign and developed a task-method structure for redesign. In constructing a system for redesign a large number of knowledge-related choices and decisions are made. In order to describe all relevant choices in redesign problem solving, we have to extend the current notion of possible relations between tasks and methods in a PSM architecture. The realization of a task by a problem-solving method, and the decomposition of a problem-solving method into subtasks are the most common relations in a PSM architecture. However, we suggest to extend these relations with the notions of task refinement and method refinement. These notions represent intermediate decisions in a task-method structure, in which the competence of a task or method is refined without immediately paying attention to its operationalization in terms of subtasks.

The progress of ATM networks appears to be at risk due to the lack of a universal, open, and efficient ATM network control platform. The emerging Private Network to Network Interface (PNNI) standard introduces a control platform that can be used as an internetwork and possibly as an intra-network solution. However, the current PNNI still falls short in providing an acceptable universal solution, due to lack of performance optimizations for intra-network operation, limited functionality, and the lack of open interfaces for future functional extensions and services. OPENET is a common portable, open, and high-performance network control platform based on performance and functional enhancements to the PNNI standard. It is vendor-independent, scalable (in terms of network size and volume of calls), high-performance (in terms of call processing latency and throughput), and extensible (in terms of integrating customer-specific and value-added services). OPENET is designed as an extension to current PNNI so it can serve as a next generation PNNI. It is compatible with PNNI in the internetworking environment allowing large networks to be partitioned according to natural topological or organizational boundaries rather than the artificial use of internet-work interfaces at vendor boundaries. This report describes the OPENET architecture. The major novelties of the OPENET architecture compared to the current PNNI are: the use of native ATM switching for the dissemination of utilization updates; lightweight call setup; take down and modification signaling; a new signaling paradigm that better supports fast reservation and multicast services; and a rich signaling infrastructure that enables the development of augmented services (such as mobility, directory, etc.), leveraging the existing functions of the network control platform.  </abstract>::line_number::4",922,false

This work actually provides examples where parallel or parallel-style code enables extracting more parallelism than standard serial code. The arbitrary concurrent-write convention is useful in parallel algorithms and programs and appears to be not too difficult to implement in hardware for serial machines. Still, typically concurrent-writes to the same memory location in a program are implemented by queuing the write operations, thus requiring time linear in the number of writes. We call this the Queuing Concurrent-Writes Paradox. Assuming that providing useful, easy-to-program programming paradigms to improve the overall effectiveness of computer systems is of interest, this work is a modest example for applying such software-driven considerations to computer architecture issues. This work may be the first to relate parallel algorithms and parallel programming with the technology of instruction level parallelism.  </abstract>::line_number::3",923,false

We assume that the robot can identify these landmarks and measure their bearings relative to each other. Given such noisy input, the algorithm estimates the robot's position and orientation with respect to the map of the environment. The algorithm makes efficient use of our representation of the landmarks by complex numbers. The algorithm runs in time linear in the number of landmarks.

A scalar measure of an object's complexity, which is invariant under affine transformation and changes in image noise level, is extracted from the object's Fisher information. The volume of Fisher information is shown to provide an overall statistical measure of the object's recognizability in a particular image, while the complexity provides an intrinsically physical measure that characterizes the object in any image. An information-conserving method is then developed for recognizing an object imaged in a complex scene. Here the term information-conserving means that the method uses all the measured data pertinent to the object's recognizability, attains the theoretical lower bound on estimation error for any unbiased estimate of the parameter vector describing the object, and therefore is statistically optimal. This method is then successfully applied to finding objects imaged in thousands of complex real-world scenes.  </abstract>::line_number::6",926,false

Such a system significantly improves search as problem complexity is increased. However, there is still considerable scope for improvement. In collective adaptation, search agents gather knowledge of their environment and deposit it in a central information repository. Process agents are then able to manipulate that focused knowledge, exploiting the exploration of the search agents. We examine the utility of increasing the capabilities of the centralized process agents.  </abstract>::line_number::7",927,false

Converting an image database into a usable catalog is typically carried out manually at present. For many larger image databases the purely manual approach is completely impractical. In this paper we describe the development of a trainable cataloging system: the user indicates the location of the objects of interest for a number of training images and the system learns to detect and catalog these objects in the rest of the database. In particular we describe the application of this system to the cataloging of small volcanoes in radar images of Venus. The volcano problem is of interest because of the scale (30,000 images, order of 1 million detectable volcanoes), technical difficulty (the variability of the volcanoes in appearance) and the scientific importance of the problem. The problem of uncertain or subjective ground truth is of fundamental importance in cataloging problems of this nature and is discussed in some detail. Experimental results are presented which quantify and compare the detection performance of the system relative to human detection performance. The paper concludes by discussing the limitations of the proposed system and the lessons learned of general relevance to the development of digital image libraries.  </abstract>::line_number::7",929,false

Perfect Sampling using CFTP has been successfully extended to the context of point processes, amongst other authors, by Haggstrom et al. [5]. In [5] Gibbs sampling is applied to a bivariate point process, the penetrable spheres mixture model [19]. However, in general the running time of CFTP in terms of number of transitions is not independent of the state sampled. Thus an impatient user who aborts long runs may introduce a subtle bias, the user impatience bias. Fill [3] introduced an exact sampling algorithm for finite state space Markov chains which, in contrast to CFTP, is unbiased for user impatience. Fill's algorithm is a form of rejection sampling and similar to CFTP requires sufficient mono-tonicity properties of the transition kernel used. We show how Fill's version of rejection sampling can be extended to an infinite state space context to produce an exact sample of the penetrable spheres mixture process and related models. Following [5] we use Gibbs sampling and make use of the partial order of the mixture model state space. Thus  </abstract>::line_number::4",930,false

We examine and compare a number of different notions of program refinement for Unity. Two of these notions are based on execution sequences. Refinement corresponds to the reduction of the set of execution sequences, i.e. reducing the amount of nondeterminism. The other refinement notions are based on Unity properties as introduced by Chandy and Misra. The Unity approach is to refine specifications. Although it has proven a suitable formalism for deriving algorithms, it seems less suitable for handling implementation details. Following Sanders and Singh, we formalize program refinement in the Unity framework as the preservation of Unity properties. We show that Unity properties are not powerful enough to characterize execution sequences. As a consequence, the notion of property-preserving refinement differs from the notion of reducing the set of execution sequences.  </abstract>::line_number::7",932,false

We propose a new infrastructure to harness the combined resources, such as CPU cycles or disk storage, and make them available to everyone interested. This infrastructure has the potential for solving parallel supercomputing applications involving thousands of cooperating components. Our approach is based on recent advances in Internet connectivity and the implementation of safe distributed computing embodied in languages such as Java. We developed a prototype of a global computing infrastructure, called SuperWeb, that consists of hosts, brokers and clients. Hosts register a fraction of their computing resources (CPU time, memory, bandwidth, disk space) with resource brokers. Client computations are then mapped by the broker onto the registered resources. We examine an economic model for trading computing resources, and discuss several technical challenges associated with such a global computing environment.  </abstract>::line_number::5",934,false
