<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> The problem of collecting responses in multi-hop radio networks is considered. A given node, called the source, is to collect a specified number of  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> responses from nodes in a radio network. The problem arises in several  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> applications of distributed systems. A deterministic and a randomized protocol for the problem are presented. The two protocols are analyzed and  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> their performance is compared. Conclusions are drawn about the suitability  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> of our protocols in various network environments.   </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract> This paper presents a new approach to implement fast barrier synchronization in wormhole k-ary  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> n-cubes. The novelty lies in using multidestination  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> messages instead of the traditional single destination  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> messages. Two different multidestination worm types,  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> gather and broadcasting, are introduced to implement  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> the report and wake-up phases of barrier synchronization, respectively. Algorithms for complete and arbitrary set barrier synchronization are presented using  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> these new worms. It is shown that complete barrier  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> synchronization in a k-ary n-cube system with e-cube  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> routing can be implemented with 2n communication  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> start-ups as compared to 2n log 2 k start-ups needed  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> with unicast-based message passing. For arbitrary set  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> barrier, an interesting trend is observed where the synchronization cost keeps on reducing beyond a certain  </abstract>::line_number::21

<abstract>  Abstract| This paper focuses on efficient multicasting in  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> wormhole-routed networks. A trip-based model is proposed  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> to support adaptive, distributed, and deadlock-free multiple  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> multicast on any network with arbitrary topology using at  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> most two virtual channels per physical channel. This model  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> significantly generalizes the path-based model proposed earlier [21], [22], which works only for Hamiltonian networks  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> and can not be applicable to networks with arbitrary topology resulted due to system faults. Fundamentals of the trip-based model, including the necessary and sufficient condition to be deadlock-free, and the use of appropriate number  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> of virtual channels to avoid deadlock are investigated. The  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> potential of this model is illustrated by applying it to hyper-cubes with faulty nodes. Simulation results indicate that the  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> proposed model can implement multiple multicast on faulty  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> In this paper we introduce a new approach to the deformation of surface and raster  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> models in two and three dimensions. Rather then deforming the objects in the  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> model, we deform the rays used to render the scene. The mechanism to specify the  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> deformation, which we call a deector, is a vector of gravity positioned in space.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> This gravity vector bends any ray that travels through its field of gravity. Images  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> generated by these curved rays give the impression of a deformed space. Unlike  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> previous methods that deform all the objects in the scene, our approach deforms  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> only those parts of the model that contribute to the final image. In addition, using  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> deectors, our approach can deform any object type that can be rendered by a ray  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> casting algorithm, providing a unified solution to space deformation.   </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> Implicit curves are widely used in computer graphics because of their powerful features for modeling and their ability for general function description. The most popular rasterization techniques for implicit curves are space subdivision and curve  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> tracking. In this paper we are introducing an efficient curve tracking algorithm that  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> is also more robust then existing methods. We employ the Predictor-Corrector  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Method on the implicit function to get a very accurate curve approximation in a  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> short time. Speedup is achieved by adapting the step size to the curvature. In addition, we provide mechanisms to detect and properly handle bifurcation points,  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> where the curve intersects itself. Finally, the algorithm allows the user to trade-off  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> accuracy for speed and vice a versa. We conclude by providing examples that dem-onstrate the capabilities of our algorithm.   </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> This paper identifies performance degradation in wormhole routed k-ary n-cube networks due  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> to limited number of router-to-processor consumption channels at each node. Many recent research  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> in wormhole routing have advocated the advantages of adaptive routing and virtual channel flow  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> control schemes to deliver better network performance. This paper indicates that the advantages  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> associated with these schemes can not be realized with limited consumption capacity. To alleviate  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> such performance bottleneck, a new network interface design using multiple consumption channels  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> is proposed. To match virtual multiplexing on network channels, we also propose each consumption  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> channel to support multiple virtual consumption channels. The impact of message arrival rate at  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> a node on the required number of consumption channel is studied analytically. It is shown that  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> wormhole networks with higher routing adaptivity, dimensionality, degree of hot-spot traffic, and  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> number of virtual lanes have to take advantage of multiple consumption channels to deliver better  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> performance. The interplay between system topology, routing algorithm, number of virtual lanes,  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> messaging overheads, and communication traffic is studied through simulation to derive the effective  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> number of consumption channels required in a system. Using the on-going technological trend, it is  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> shown that wormhole-routed systems can use up to 2-4 consumption channels per node to deliver  </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract>  Abstract: How do we formally specify the relation between a base class and a  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> derived class? This question has two parts, a syntactic one, and a semantic one.  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> The syntactic part is of course the easier of the two and the answer to that part is  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> the standard contra/co- variance requirement on the arguments and result of any  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> base class method redefined in the derived class. Our concern in the current paper  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> is with the semantic part of the question, i.e., how do we specify the behavioral  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> relation between the base class and the derived class? We show that the standard  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> answer -which is the semantic counterpart of contra/co-variance- is too rigid, and  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> does not allow some natural and common forms of inheritance. We then propose a  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> more flexible way to specify the relation, and show how different types of behavioral relations between base classes and derived classes may be specified using our  </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> ATM Forum specifies public key cryptography to be the default ATM authentication mechanism and directory services like X.509 to be the infrastructure for public  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> key distribution and certification. Authenticated signaling, widely acknowledged  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> as a necessary security feature of ATM network, requires the signaling message to  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> be authenticated with a digital signature signed by the private key of the calling  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> party. To verify the digital signature, the called party needs to obtain the public  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> key of the calling party and a proof of the calling party's ownership to that public  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> key. In X.509, the standard form of such a proof is a chain of public key certificates, called the certificate path between two parties. Certificate exchange protocol  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> (CEP), proposed by ATM Forum, requires that another bi-directional connection  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> be established between two parties to exchange public keys and certificate paths  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> before an authenticated connection can be set up, which is not an ideal approach.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> We propose an algorithm which is embedded into ATM routing protocols to generate a certificate path inside a signaling message on-the-fly as the signaling message  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> travels through the ATM network. In this approach, all that a calling party needs  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> to know for authentication purpose is its own public key certificate and the ATM  </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> The problem of concurrent mapping and localization has received considerable attention in the mobile robotics community. With few exceptions, existing approaches can largely be  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> grouped into two distinct paradigms: topological and metric.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> This paper proposes a method that integrates both paradigms.  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> It poses the mapping problem as a statistical maximum likelihood problem, and devises an efficient algorithm for search  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> in likelihood space. Based on that, it presents an novel mapping algorithm that integrates two phases: a topological and a  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> metric mapping phase. The topological mapping phase solves a  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> global position alignment problem between potentially indistinguishable, significant places. The subsequent metric mapping  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> phase produces a fine-grained metric map of the environment  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> in floating-point resolution. Experimental results in cyclic environments of sizes up to 80 by 25 meters demonstrate the  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> appropriateness of this approach.   </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> A simple polygon P is said to have a Hamilitonian Triangulation if it has a triangulation  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> whose dual graph contains a Hamiltonian path. Such triangulations are useful in fast  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> rendering engines in Computer Graphics. Arkin et al. [AHMS] observed that a polygon  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> has a Hamiltonian triangulation if and only if it is Discretely Straight Walkable, a concept  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> that is a discrete version of Straight Walkability concept as introduced by Icking and Klein  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> [IK]. Using this characterization, Arkin et al. also showed an algorithm to recognize such  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> polygons in time that is linear in the size of the visibility polygon of the given polygon P .  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> The size of the visbility polygon of P could be quadratic in the size of P and hence their  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> algorithm could be very inefficient even for nearly convex polygons.  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> We give a new characterization of polygons with Hamiltonian triangulations. We use  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> this characterization to present the following algorithms:  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> * An O(n log n)-time algorithm to recognize polygons with a Hamiltonian triangulation.  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> * An O(n log n)-time algorithm to construct such a triangulation.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> * Given vertices p and q on a simple polygon, an O(n)-time algorithm to determine  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> whether the polygon is discretely straight walkable with respect to the two vertices.  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> * An O(n log n)-time algorithm to list out all pairs of points on a simple polygon with  </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract>  ABSTRACT  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> This paper discusses several current attempts to use acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation for modeling  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> physical phenomena and the role that wavelet analysis is playing in these efforts. The first problem involves recent  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> application of wavelets to computational fluid dynamics. The second problem involves geophysical modeling of the  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> ocean floor, using acoustic waves, and wavelets have recently been shown to play an important role here already.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The third problem involves modeling of SAR radar images in the context of automatic target recognition efforts.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> The fourth problem is global illumination in computer graphics, i.e., simulation of reflected and absorbed light  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> for everyday environments. The role of wavelets is more embryonic in these latter two areas, but there are some  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> common principles in all of these modeling efforts, and the methodology of wavelets seems well suited to certain  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> aspects of these problems.   </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> Computer security professionals and researchers do not have a history of sharing and analyzing computer  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> vulnerability information. Scientists and engineers from older or more established fields have long understood  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> that publicizing, analyzing, and learning from other people's mistakes is essential to the stepwise refinement  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> of complex systems. Computer scientists, however, have not followed suit. Programmers reinvent classical  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> programming mistakes, contributing to the reappearance of known vulnerabilities.  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> In the recent past, computer systems have come to be a part of critical systems that have a direct effect  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> on the safety and well-being of human beings and hence we must have lower tolerance for software failures.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> In the dissertation I will attempt to show that computer vulnerability information presents important  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> regularities and these can be detected, and possibly visualized, providing important insight about the reason  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> of their prevalence and existence. The information derived from these observations could be used to improve on  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> all phases of the development of software systems, as could be in the design, development, debugging, testing  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> and maintenance of complex computer systems that must implement a set of policies defined by security  </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract>  ABSTRACT  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> Many operating systems have long had pseudo-teletypes, inter-process  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> communication channels that provide terminal semantics on one end,  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> and a smart server program on the other. We describe an analogous  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> concept, pseudo-network drivers. One end of the driver appears to be  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> a real network device, with the appropriate interface and semantics;  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> data written to it goes to a program, however, rather than to a physical  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> medium. Using this and some auxiliary mechanisms, we present a  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> variety of applications, including system test, network monitoring,  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> dial-up TCP/IP, and ways to both improve and subvert network  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> security. Most notably, we show how pseudo-network devices can be  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> used to create virtual networks and to provide encrypted  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> communications capability. We describe two implementations, one  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> using a conventional driver for socket-based systems, and one using  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> stream pipes for System V.   </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> In 1972, Reynolds outlined a general method for eliminating functional arguments known as defunctionalization. The  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> idea underlying defunctionalization is encoding functional  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> values as first-order data, and then to realized the applications of the encoded function via an apply function. Although this process is simple enough, problems arise when  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> defunctionalization is used in a polymorphic language. In  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> such a language, a functional argument of a higher-order  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> function can take different type instances in different applications. As a consequence, its associated apply function can  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> be untypable in the soucre language. In the paper we present  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> a defunctionalization transformation which preserves typa-bility. Moreover, the transformation imposes no restriction  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> on functional arguments of recursive functions, and it handles functions as results as well as functions encapsulated in  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> constructors or tuples. The key to this success is the use  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> of type information in the defunctionalization transformation. Run-time characteristics are preserved by defunction-alization; hence, there is no performance improvement coming from the transformation itself. However closures need  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> not be implemented to compile the transformed program.  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> Since the defunctionalization is driven by type information,  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> it can also easily perform a specialization of higher-order  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> functions with respect to the values of their functional arguments, hence gaining a real run-time improvement of the  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> transformed program.   </abstract>::line_number::24

<abstract> Recent advances in the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Dynamic Host Configuration  </abstract>::line_number::5

<abstract> location independent naming for nomadic computers, i.e., machines that do not need transparent  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> mobility. Our protocol allows hosts to move across security domains, uses existing protocols, and  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> preserves existing trust relationships. Therefore, it preserves the performance and security of  </abstract>::line_number::11

<date>  October 24, 1996   </date>::line_number::11
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> We give a review of basic statistical and neural techniques for classification. Statistical techniques are based on the idea of estimating class-conditional likelihoods and using Bayes rule  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> to convert these to posterior class probabilities whereas neural techniques estimate directly the  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> posteriors. Statistical techniques include (i) Parametric (Gaussian) Bayes classifiers, (ii) Non-parametric kernel-based density estimators like k-nearest neighbor and Parzen windows, and  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> (iii) mixtures of (Gaussian) densities (a special case of which is the Learning Vector Quantization). As neural classifiers, we include simple perceptrons and multilayer perceptrons with  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> sigmoid and Gaussian hidden units. The neural and statistical techniques are quite similar in  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> many respects and many approaches have been discovered independently twice, once in 1960s  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> by statisticians and once in 1980s by the neural network researchers. One of the aims of this article is to make this link more apparent. We also discuss two, most popular, pattern recognition  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> applications: Optical character recognition and speech recognition. Though they seem different,  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> in many respects, the two applications are similar and in the past, almost the same techniques  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> have been applied for their implementation. We implement the well known statistical and neural  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> classification techniques for two datasets of these applications and compare them in terms of  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> generalization accuracy, memory requirement and learning time. We especially advise to take  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> into account statistics of the sample even if a neural classifier is to be used. The similarity  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> between statistical and neural techniques is greater than generally agreed and simple statistical  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> methods like k-NN perform generally quite well and much of the functionality of neural networks like distributed parallel computation can be obtained by such methods without requiring  </abstract>::line_number::27

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> We define a standard of effectiveness for a database calculus  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> relative to a query language. Effectiveness judges suitability  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> to serve as a processing framework for the query language,  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> and comprises aspects of coverage, manipulability and  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> efficient evaluation. We present the monoid calculus, and  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> argue its effectiveness for object-oriented query languages,  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> exemplified by OQL of ODMG-93. The monoid calculus  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> readily captures such features as multiple collection types,  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> aggregations, arbitrary composition of type constructors and  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> nested query expressions. We also show how to extend  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> the monoid calculus to deal with vectors and arrays in  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> more expressive ways than current query languages do, and  </abstract>::line_number::19

<keyword>  Keywords: Register Allocation, Continuation-passing Style, Procedure Call   </keyword>::line_number::6
<abstract>  Abstract. Continuation-passing style (CPS) is a good abstract representation to use  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> for compilation and optimization: it has a clean semantics and is easily manipulated.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> We examine how CPS expresses the saving and restoring of registers in source-language  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> procedure calls. In most CPS-based compilers, the context of the calling procedure is  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> saved in a "continuation closure"|a single variable that is passed as an argument to the  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> function being called. This closure is a record containing bindings of all the free variables  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> of the continuation; that is, registers that hold values needed by the caller "after the call"  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> are written to memory in the closure, and fetched back after the call.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> Consider the procedure-call mechanisms used by conventional compilers. In particular,  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> registers holding values needed after the call must be saved and later restored. The  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> responsibility for saving registers can lie with the caller (a "caller-saves" convention)  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> or with the called function ("callee-saves"). In practice, to optimize memory traffic,  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> compilers find it useful to have some caller-saves registers and some callee-saves.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> "Conventional" CPS-based compilers that pass a pointer to a record containing all  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> the variables needed after the call (i.e., the continuation closure), are using a caller-saves  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> convention. We explain how to express callee-save registers in Continuation-Passing  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> Style, and give measurements showing the resulting improvement in execution time.   </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> We propose several new techniques for resource management in a replicated object server. By coordinating cache  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> and disk usage among the replicas, these techniques increase throughput and reduce fetch latency. Cache splitting  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> speeds up fetches by avoiding redundant cache entries, effectively increasing the cache size. Coordinated writing  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> coordinates disk writes to ensure that one replica is always  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> available to service fetches. We investigate the performance  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> of a replicated server using these techniques, and we present  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> simulation results showing that these techniques provide  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> substantial performance improvements across a variety of  </abstract>::line_number::14

<date>  June 24, 1994   </date>::line_number::7
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> This paper describes several of our experiences with a real-time scheduler. Using a robot control application program, we motivate the importance of supporting multiple schedulers within the same application  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> program. We demonstrate the utility of speculative task execution in dynamic real-time systems, and describe the implementation of a scheduler for performing speculative execution and recovery. We show that  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> existing real-time scheduler interfaces have scope for improvement, especially when scheduling latency must  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> be low and when multiple schedulers used by a single application must co-exist on a single processor. A new  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> scheduler interface is specified and its basic costs are evaluated experimentally. Preliminary measurements on  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> a KSR-1 machine are quoted. The measurements demonstrate how the execution times of temporal queries  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> may be reduced by use of access structures to scheduler data structures. Finally, there are several overheads  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> associated with speculative execution, and multiple schedulers in a single application. We consider the problem of on-line reconfiguration of the several overheads associated with the speculative-execution paradigm  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> for optimal performance in the face of these overheads. Initial performance measurements of the PORTS  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> scheduler indicate that it is possible to perform real-time scheduling with latencies approximating those of  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> proposed specialized scheduling co-processors.   </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Multicast routing is an important topic of both theoretical and practical  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> interest. Some recently-proposed multicast routing algorithms involve the  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> designation of one or more network nodes as the "center" of the routing  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> tree for each multicast group address. The choice of this designated router  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> (which we refer to as the "core") influences the shape of the multicast routing  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> tree, and thus influences performance of the routing scheme. In this paper we  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> investigate the relationship between the choice of core and three performance  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> measures. Specifically, we compare various methods of selecting a core with  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> respect to their effect on bandwidth, delay, and traffic concentration. We  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> conclude that simple methods are adequate for widely distributed groups,  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> but that the addition of group information can be leveraged to improve  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> performance especially when the group is small or exhibits a high degree  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> of locality. We also conclude that core choice has a significant impact on  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> traffic concentration, in fact traffic concentration effects can be ameliorated  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> by appropriate core choice policies.   </abstract>::line_number::22

<title>  Interactive Model-Based Image Understanding   </title>::line_number::0
<author>  Daryl T. Lawton Warren F. Gardner   </author>::line_number::1
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::2
<abstract> This paper describes a general architecture for an interactive model-based vision system. A  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> human specifies a limited amount of information which establishes a context for autonomous interpretation of images. Object models are described by constraints specifying necessary geometrical  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> properties and relationships between objects. The use of constraints allows for flexible object in-stantiation. A user can indicate an object in a scene and this directs perceptual processing routines  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> as well as constraining future object instantiations. This interactive model-based concept has been  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> applied to the domain of vehicle tracking, and this paper concludes with several processing examples  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> from this domain.   </abstract>::line_number::8

<abstract>  Computer networks hold the potential to coordinate the activities of multiple machines so that their combined computational abilities can be applied to solving a single problem. Several methods have been developed over the years to  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> harness the power of networked systems for solving certain classes of problems. One such class of problems is the distributed producer/consumer problem, in which a set of producer processes supply items to a set of consumer processes. Each  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> of the processes involved resides on a different machine, with the machines being connected by a network and the processes communicating via message passing. The problem, then, is how to coordinate the activities of the producers and consumers so that an acceptable level of throughput can be maintained with a minimal amount of overhead. This paper  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> presents a simple solution to the distributed producer/consumer problem. This solution, which is based upon the notion of  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> a distributed pool, is described in detail and its performance analyzed. As the analysis shows, the distributed pools algorithm presented herein is a simple, efficient solution to the distributed producer/consumer problem, and is capable of better than 90% efficiency under common conditions. Its major failing is that it needs the production rates of the producers  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> to be reasonably similar.   </abstract>::line_number::9

<abstract> selection predicate index uses a new type of interval index called the interval skip list (IS-list).  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> The IS-list is designed to allow efficient retrieval of all intervals that overlap a point, while allowing  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> dynamic insertion and deletion of intervals. IS-list algorithms are described in detail. The IS-list  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> allows efficient on-line searches, insertions, and deletions, yet is much simpler to implement than  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> other comparable interval index data structures such as the priority search tree and balanced  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> interval binary search tree (IBS-tree). IS-lists require only one third as much code to implement  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> as balanced IBS-trees. The combination of simplicity, performance, and dynamic updateability  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> of the IS-list is unmatched by any other interval index data structure. This makes the IS-list a  </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Shape modeling is an important constituent of computer vision as well as computer graphics  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> research. Shape models aid the tasks of object representation and recognition. This paper  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> presents a new approach to shape modeling which retains some of the attractive features of  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> existing methods, and overcomes some of their limitations. Our techniques can be applied to  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> model arbitrarily complex shapes, which include shapes with significant protrusions, and to  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> situations where no a priori assumption about the object's topology is made. A single instance  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> of our model, when presented with an image having more than one object of interest, has the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> ability to split freely to represent each object. This method is based on the ideas developed  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> by Osher and Sethian to model propagating solid/liquid interfaces with curvature-dependent  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> speeds. The interface (front) is a closed, nonintersecting, hypersurface flowing along its gradient  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> field with constant speed or a speed that depends on the curvature. It is moved by solving a  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> "Hamilton-Jacobi" type equation written for a function in which the interface is a particular  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> level set. A speed term synthesized from the image is used to stop the interface in the vicinity of  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> object boundaries. The resulting equation of motion is solved by employing entropy-satisfying  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> upwind finite difference schemes. We present a variety of ways of computing evolving front,  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> including narrow bands, reinitializations, and different stopping criteria. The efficacy of the  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> scheme is demonstrated with numerical experiments on some synthesized images and some low  </abstract>::line_number::25

<abstract> Two-way authentication methods are inefficient when used to authenticate multiple users who wish to communicate securely with each other. M-way, also called conference authentication, is designed to efficiently authenticate many users and distribute a secure common conference key. Unfortunately, few if any conference  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> authentication schemes have been developed and/or performance tested in a real distributed system. This report  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> attempts to rectify this problem. Specifically, it presents the performance of both a star and a ring-based conference authentication scheme that has been developed for the RHODOS distributed operating system. As with most  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> systems, RHODOS does not have any special hardware, thus, a software based solution is utilised. This report  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract> The appearance of an object or a face changes continuously as the observer  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract> simulation investigates the ability of an unsupervised learning mechanism to  </abstract>::line_number::15

<author>  Harold W. Thimbleby, Stuart Inglis, and Ian H. Witten *   </author>::line_number::2
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> This paper describes how to generate a single image which, when viewed in the  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> appropriate way, appears to the brain as a 3D scene. The image is a stereogram composed  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> of seemingly random dots. A new, simple and symmetric algorithm for generating such  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> images from a solid model is given, along with the design parameters and their influence  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> on the display. The algorithm improves on previously-described ones in several ways: it  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> is symmetric and hence free from directional (right-to-left or left-to-right) bias, it corrects  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> a slight distortion in the rendering of depth, it removes hidden parts of surfaces, and it  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> also eliminates a type of artifact that we call an echo.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Random dot stereograms have one remaining problem: difficulty of initial viewing. If  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> a computer screen rather than paper is used for output, the problem can be ameliorated by  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> shimmering, or time-multiplexing of pixel values. We also describe a simple  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> computational technique for determining what is present in a stereogram so that, if  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> viewing is difficult, one can ascertain what to look for.   </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> Current Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services implement a variety of semantics, with many of the differences  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> related to how communication and server failures are handled. The list increases even more when considering group  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> RPC, a variant of RPC often used for fault-tolerance where  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> an invocation is sent to a group of servers rather than one.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> This paper presents an approach to constructing group  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> RPC in which a single configurable system is used to build  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> different variants of the service. The approach is based on  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> implementing each property as a separate software module  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> called a micro-protocol, and then configuring the micro-protocols needed to implement the desired service together  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> using a software framework based on the x-kernel. The  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> properties of point-to-point and group RPC are identified  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> and classified, and the general execution model described.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> An example consisting of a modular implementation of a  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> group RPC service is given to illustrate the approach. Dependency issues that restrict configurability are also addressed.   </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> This paper describes the application of Parallel Distributed Genetic Programming (PDGP) to the problem of inducing programs for natural language processing.  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> PDGP is a new form of Genetic Programming (GP) which is suitable for the development of programs with a high degree of parallelism and an efficient and effective  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> reuse of partial results. Programs are represented in PDGP as graphs with nodes  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> representing functions and terminals, and links representing the flow of control and  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> results. PDGP allows the exploration of a large space of possible programs including standard tree-like programs, logic networks, neural networks, finite state  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> automata, Recursive Transition Networks (RTNs), etc. The paper describes the  </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> The problem of programming an artificial ant to follow the Santa Fe trail is used as an example  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> program search space. Analysis of shorter solutions shows they have many of the characteristics  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> often ascribed to manually coded programs. Enumeration of a small fraction of the total search  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> space and random sampling characterise it as rugged with many multiple plateaus split by deep  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> valleys and many local and global optima. This suggests it is difficult for hill climbing algorithms.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> Analysis of the program search space in terms of fixed length schema suggests it is highly deceptive  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> and that for the simplest solutions large building blocks must be assembled before they have above  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> average fitness. In some cases we show solutions cannot be assembled using a fixed representation  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> from small building blocks of above average fitness. These suggest the Ant problem is difficult for  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> Genetic Algorithms.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> Random sampling of the program search space suggests on average the density of global optima  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> changes only slowly with program size but the density of neutral networks linking points of the same  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> fitness grows approximately linearly with program length. This is part of the cause of bloat.  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> Previously reported genetic programming, simulated annealing and hill climbing performance is  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> shown not to be much better than random search on the Ant problem.   </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> In this paper we present the GP-Music System, an interactive system which allows users to evolve short musical sequences  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> using interactive genetic programming, and its extensions aimed at making the system fully automated. The basic GP-system works by using a genetic programming algorithm, a small set of functions for creating musical sequences, and a user  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> interface which allows the user to rate individual sequences. With this user interactive technique it was possible to generate  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> pleasant tunes over runs of 20 individuals over 10 generations. As the user is the bottleneck in interactive systems, the  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> system takes rating data from a users run and uses it to train a neural network based automatic rater, or auto rater, which  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> can replace the user in bigger runs. Using this auto rater we were able to make runs of up to 50 generations with 500  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> individuals per generation. The best of run pieces generated by the auto raters were pleasant but were not, in general, as  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> nice as those generated in user interactive runs.   </abstract>::line_number::26

<abstract> a measure of performance of an asynchronous circuit.  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> We show how to model energy consumption based on  </abstract>::line_number::7

<abstract> how to dimension a memory array, and how to break  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> up this memory array into smaller arrays to minimize  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> the energy per access. We then show how to use cache  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract>  Abstract. A critical challenge faced by the developer of a software system is to understand whether the system's components correctly integrate. While type theory has provided substantial help in detecting and  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> preventing errors in mismatched static properties, much work remains  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> in the area of dynamics. In particular, components make assumptions  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> about their behavioral interaction with other components, but currently  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> we have only limited ways in which to state those assumptions and to  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> analyze those assumptions for correctness.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> We have begun to formulate a method that addresses this problem. The  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> method operates at the architectural level so that behavioral integration  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> errors, such as deadlock, can be revealed early in development. For each  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> component, a specification is given both of its own interaction behavior  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> and of the assumptions that it makes about the interaction behavior of  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> the external context in which it expects to operate. We have defined an  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> algorithm that, given such specifications for a set of components, performs "adequacy" checks between the component context assumptions  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> and the component interaction behaviors. A configuration of a system is  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> possible if and only if a successful way of "matching" actual behaviors  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> with assumptions can be found. In effect, we are extending the usual no  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> tion of type checking to include the checking of behavioral compatibility.   </abstract>::line_number::28

<abstract> This paper presents a method that can be used for  </abstract>::line_number::10

<abstract> a product. The method centers on the role of the facilitator, an independent agent whose purpose is to build  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> the Integrated System Model (ISM). The ISM is the result of merging the independent system views from all  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> stakeholders at any given abstraction level. Formulation of this method was based on the real-world experience of developing a complex, high-technology medical  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> product with critical time-to-market pressures. It has  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> proven to be a practical approach to the evolution of  </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract>  Abstract. The problem of finding the naturally occurring structure of a protein is believed to correspond to minimizing the free, or potential, energy of  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> the protein. This is generally a very difficult global optimization problem, with  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> a large number of parameters and a huge number of local minimizers including many with function values near that of the global minimizer. This paper  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> presents a new global optimization method for such problems. The method  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> consists of an initial phase that locates some reasonably low local minimizers of  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the energy function, followed by the main phase that progresses from the best  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> current local minimizers to even lower local minimizers. The method combines  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> portions that work on small subsets of the parameters, including small-scale  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> global optimizations using stochastic methods, with local minimizations involving all the parameters. In computational tests on the protein polyalanine  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> with up to 58 amino acids (116 internal parameters), the method appears to  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> be very successful in finding the lowest energy structures. The largest case  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> is particularly significant because the lowest energy structures that are found  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> include ones that exhibit interesting tertiary as opposed to just secondary  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> structure.   </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract> In this position paper we raise the question of whether Configuration Management (CM)  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> research has a future. The new standard in CM systems|typified by commercial products  </abstract>::line_number::8

<abstract> functionality requirements posed by Dart. This implies that research in the area of CM is either  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> unnecessary or that we must find new challenges in CM on which to focus. We believe that  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> these challenges indeed exist. Here we present some areas that we feel are good opportunities  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> for new or continued CM research, and therefore conclude that CM research does have a future.   </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> In this paper we propose a new framework for  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> studying Markov decision processes (MDPs),  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> based on ideas from statistical mechanics. The  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> goal of learning in MDPs is to find a policy  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> that yields the maximum expected return over  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> time. In choosing policies, agents must therefore weigh the prospects of short-term versus  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> long-term gains. We study a simple MDP in  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> which the agent must constantly decide between exploratory jumps and local reward mining in state space. The number of policies to  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> choose from grows exponentially with the size  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> of the state space, N . We view the expected returns as defining an energy landscape over policy space. Methods from statistical mechanics  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> are used to analyze this landscape in the thermodynamic limit N ! 1. We calculate the  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> overall distribution of expected returns, as well  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> as the distribution of returns for policies at a  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> fixed Hamming distance from the optimal one.  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> We briefly discuss the problem of learning optimal policies from empirical estimates of the  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> expected return. As a first step, we relate our  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> findings for the entropy to the limit of high-temperature learning. Numerical simulations  </abstract>::line_number::24

<abstract> simpler, elemental MDTs. The architecture is trained on a set of composite and elemental MDTs. The temporal structure of a composite task is  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> assumed to be unknown and the architecture learns to produce a temporal decomposition. It is shown that under certain conditions the solution  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> There is increasing interest in the recovery of generalized cylinders (GCs) with curved spines. However,  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> existing formulations of such GCs, for example those  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> based on the Frenet-Serret frame or the tube model,  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> suffer serious drawbacks: discontinuities, a lack of expressive power, "narrowing" in the plane normal to  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> the spine, non-intuitive twisting behavior, and/or off-axis nonorthogonality of their local coordinate systems.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> We discuss some of the problems associated with the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> non-orthogonality of the coordinate system based on  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> the Frenet-Serret frame. This non-orthogonality is induced by torsion effects and we show how to correct for  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> it. We then introduce a new model, the extruded GC  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> (EGC) model, which overcomes all the problems mentioned above. For complex axes, the EGC model is also  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> simpler to understand and use than existing models.  </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract>  Abstract. Let F be a class of functions defined on a d-dimensional domain. Our task is  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> to compute H m -norm "-approximations to solutions of 2mth-order elliptic boundary-value  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> problems Lu = f for a fixed L and for f 2 F . We assume that the only information we  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> can compute about f 2 F is the value of a finite number of continuous linear functionals  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> of f, each evaluation having cost c(d). Previous work has assumed that F was the unit  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> ball of a Sobolev space H r of fixed smoothness r, and it was found that the complexity of  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> computing an "-approximation was comp("; d) = fi(c(d)(1=") d=(r+m) ). Since the exponent  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> of 1=" depends on d, we see that the problem is intractable in 1=" for any such F of fixed  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> smoothness r. In this paper, we ask whether we can break intractability by letting F be the  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> unit ball of a space of infinite smoothness. To be specific, we let F be the unit ball of a  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> Hardy space of analytic functions defined over a complex d-dimensional ball of radius greater  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> than one. We then show that the problem is tractable in 1=". More precisely, we prove that  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> comp("; d) = fi(c(d)(ln 1=") d ), where the fi-constant depends on d. Since for any p &gt; 0, there  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> is a function K() such that comp("; d) c(d)K(d)(1=") p for sufficiently small ", we see that  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> the problem is tractable, with (minimal) exponent 0. Furthermore, we show how to construct  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> a finite element p-method (in the sense of Babuska) that can compute an "-approximation  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> with cost fi(c(d)(ln 1=") d ). Hence this finite element method is a nearly optimal complexity  </abstract>::line_number::27

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Expert Databases are environments that support the processing of rule programs against a disk resident database.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> They occupy a position intermediate between active and deductive databases, with respect to the level of abstraction  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> of the underlying rule language. The operational semantics  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> of the rule language influences the problem solving strategy,  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> while the architecture of the processing environment determines efficiency and scalability.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> In this paper, we present elements of the PARADISER  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> architecture and its kernel rule language, PARULEL. The  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> PARADISER environment provides support for parallel and  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> distributed evaluation of rule programs, as well as static  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> and dynamic load balancing protocols that predictively  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> balance a computation at runtime. This combination of  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> features results in a scalable database rule and complex  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> query processing architecture. We validate our claims by  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> analyzing the performance of the system for two realistic  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> test cases. In particular, we show how the performance of a  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> parallel implementation of transitive closure is significantly  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> improved by predictive dynamic load balancing.   </abstract>::line_number::25

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> We present a multi-dimensional database model,  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> which we believe can serve as a conceptual model  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> for On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP)-based  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> applications. Apart from providing the functionalities necessary for OLAP-based applications, the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> main feature of the model we propose is a clear  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> separation between structural aspects and the contents. This separation of concerns allows us to define data manipulation languages in a reasonably  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> simple, transparent way. In particular, we show  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> that the data cube operator can be expressed easily. Concretely, we define an algebra and a calculus  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> and show them to be equivalent. We conclude by  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> comparing our approach to related work.  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> The conceptual multi-dimensional database model  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> developed here is orthogonal to its implementa  </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> We consider the family of lines that are area bisectors of a polygon (possibly with  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> holes) in the plane. We say that two bisectors of a polygon P are combinatorially  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> distinct if they induce different partitionings of the vertices of P . We derive an algebraic  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> characterization of area bisectors. We then show that there are simple polygons with n  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> vertices that have (n 2 ) combinatorially distinct area bisectors (matching the obvious  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> upper bound), and present an output-sensitive algorithm for computing an explicit  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> representation of all the bisectors of a given polygon. Our study is motivated by the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> development of novel, flexible feeding devices for parts positioning and orienting. The  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> question of determining all the bisectors of polygonal parts arises in connection with  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> the development of efficient part positioning strategies when using these devices.   </abstract>::line_number::18

<date>  January 23, 1996   </date>::line_number::3
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> We propose a new algorithm for computing the Riemann mapping of the  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> unit disk to a polygon, also known as the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation.  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> The new algorithm, CRDT, is based on cross-ratios of the prevertices, and also  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> on cross-ratios of quadrilaterals in a Delaunay triangulation of the polygon.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The CRDT algorithm produces an accurate representation of the Riemann  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> mapping even in the presence of arbitrary long, thin regions in the polygon,  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> unlike any previous conformal mapping algorithm. We believe that CRDT can  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> never fail to converge to the correct Riemann mapping, but the correctness and  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> convergence proof depend on conjectures that we have so far not been able to  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> prove. We demonstrate convergence with computational experiments.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> The Riemann mapping has applications to problems in two-dimensional  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> potential theory and to finite-difference mesh generation. We use CRDT to  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> produce a mapping and solve a boundary value problem on long, thin regions  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract> We give asymptotically equal lower and upper bounds for the number of parallel I/O operations required to perform bit-matrix-multiply/complement (BMMC) permutations on parallel  </abstract>::line_number::8

<abstract> = A x c, where matrix multiplication is performed over GF (2). The characteristic matrix A  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> is (lg N )fi(lg N ) and nonsingular over GF (2). Under the Vitter-Shriver parallel-disk model with  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract> permutations, which can be performed in one pass. This subclass, which is used in the BMMC  </abstract>::line_number::32

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in the amount of  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> information available to our society. In particular, the amount of  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> information available online through vast networks like the global  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> Internet has been growing at a staggering rate. This growth rate has by far  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> exceeded the rate of growth in network speeds, as has the number of  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> individuals and organizations seeking access to this information. There is  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> thus a motivation to find abstract methods of manipulating this online  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> data in ways that both serve the needs of end users efficiently and use  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> network resources intelligently. In lieu of a traditional clientserver model  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> of information processing, which is both inflexible and potentially very  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> inefficient, a Transportable Intelligent Agent system has the potential to  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> achieve a more efficient and flexible network system. An intelligent agent  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> is a program that models the information space for a user, and allows the  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> user to specify how the information is to be processed. A transportable  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> agent can suspend its execution, transport itself to a new location on a  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> network, and resume execution at the new location. This is a particularly  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> attractive model for both wireless and dialup networks where a user might  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> not be able to maintain a permanent network connection, as well as for  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> situations where the amount of information to be processed is large  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> relative to the network bandwidth. Preliminary work in the field has  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> shown that such agent systems are possible and deserve further study.  </abstract>::line_number::31
<abstract> This thesis describes a prototype transportable intelligent agent system that  </abstract>::line_number::32
<abstract> extends work already done in the field. Agents are written in a modified  </abstract>::line_number::33
<abstract> version of the Tcl programming language and transported using TCP/IP  </abstract>::line_number::34
<abstract> connections. Several simple examples demonstrate the properties of the  </abstract>::line_number::35
<abstract> system.   </abstract>::line_number::36

<abstract> requirements of parallel scientific applications. Many multiprocessor file  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> systems provide applications with a conventional Unix-like interface, allowing the application to access multiple disks transparently. This interface conceals the parallelism within the file system, increasing the ease  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> of programmability, but making it difficult or impossible for sophisticated programmers and libraries to use knowledge about their I/O needs  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> to exploit that parallelism. In addition to providing an insufficient interface, most current multiprocessor file systems are optimized for a different  </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> This paper presents a new atomic commitment protocol, enhanced three phase commit  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> (E3PC ), that always allows a quorum in the system to make progress. Previously suggested  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> quorum-based protocols (e.g., the quorum-based three phase commit (3PC) [Ske82]) allow a  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> quorum to make progress in case of one failure. If failures cascade, however, and the quorum  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> in the system is "lost" (i.e., at a given time no quorum component exists), a quorum can later  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> become connected and still remain blocked. With our protocol, a connected quorum never  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> blocks. E3PC is based on the quorum-based 3PC [Ske82], and it does not require more time  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> or communication than 3PC. We describe how this protocol can be exploited in a replicated  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> database setting, making the database always available to a majority of the sites.   </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Data- and task-parallelism are two important parallel programming models. Object-oriented paradigm  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> in parallelism provides a good way of abstracting out various aspects of computations and computing resources. Using an object-oriented language like C++, one can compose data and control representations  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> into a single active object.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> We propose a thread model of parallelism that addresses both data and task parallelism. Computation  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> and communication can be overlapped by suspending a thread of computation which is waiting for an  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> event and running an eligible thread of computation in its place. Threads naturally subsume task-parallelism. Threads are encapsulated into thread objects may be grouped into rope objects [22, 20], that  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> span the parallel machine domain, for collective computation and communication. Thus data-parallelism  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> can be supported. Since rope objects are parallel objects, they can be customized, interestingly, in a  </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> This paper proposes a framework for predicate detection in systems of processes with approximately-synchronized real-time clocks. Timestamps from these clocks are used to define two orderings on  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> events: "definitely occurred before" and "possibly occurred before". These orderings lead naturally  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> to definitions of 3 distinct detection modalities, i.e., 3 meanings of "predicate held during a computation", namely: Poss T (" possibly held"), Def T (" definitely held"), and Inst ("  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> definitely held at a specific instant"). This paper defines these modalities and gives efficient algorithms for detecting them; the algorithms are based on algorithms of Cooper and Marzullo, Garg  </abstract>::line_number::8

<abstract> regions. Separate HMM modules were designed and trained for specific regions of  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> DNA: exons, introns, intergenic regions, and splice sites. The models were then  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> tied together to form a biologically feasible topology. The integrated HMM was  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> trained further on a set of eukaryotic DNA sequences, and tested by using it to  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> segment a separate set of sequences. The resulting HMM system, which is called  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> VEIL (Viterbi Exon-Intron Locator), obtains an overall accuracy on test data of  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> 92% of total bases correctly labelled, with a correlation coefficient of 0.68. Using the more stringent test of exact exon prediction, VEIL correctly located both  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> ends of 46% of the exons. Moreover, more than 50% of the exons it predicts are  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> exactly correct. These results compare favorably to the best previous results for  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> gene structure prediction, and demonstrate the benefits of using HMMs for this  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> problem.   </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract> The Two-Level Hypermedia Paradigm sees an  </abstract>::line_number::8

<abstract> a document network (the Hyperbase) and a  </abstract>::line_number::10

<abstract> Query by Navigation is a process whereby the  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract> formalism makes use of probabilities for mod-elling the searcher's behavious. The events  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> which can occur during the search process  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> For succesful information systems development, conceptual data modelling is essential.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> Nowadays many techniques for conceptual data modelling exist, examples are NIAM, FORM,  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> PSM, many (E)ER variants, IFO, and FDM. In-depth comparisons of concepts of these techniques is very difficult as the mathematical formalisations of these techniques, if existing at  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> all, are very different. As such there is a need for a unifying formal framework providing a  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> sufficiently high level of abstraction. In this paper the use of category theory for this purpose  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> is addressed. Well-known conceptual data modelling concepts are discussed from a category  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> theoretic point of view. Advantages and disadvantages of the approach chosen will be outlined.   </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract> It is argued that the following three properties are foundations of robust robot  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> navigation:  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> * The use of landmarks (and, in particular, the use of a compass sense),  </abstract>::line_number::10

<abstract> * the use of topological rather than geometrical maps.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> Some examples of successful animal navigation are presented that support this view.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> We have performed initial experiments with mobile robots to investigate mechanisms  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> This paper describes the performance evaluation of six temporal reasoning systems.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> We show that if you are working with large temporal datasets where information  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> is added incrementally throughout the execution of the program, systems using incompletely connected graphs (i.e., TMM, TimeGraph and TimeGraph-II) seem the  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> best option. While they do not offer the constant query time of systems using fully  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> connected graphs (i.e. the systems based on constraint satisfaction), the savings at  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> assertion time are so substantial that the relatively small performance penalty for  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> queries is a reasonable tradeoff. Of course, these systems do not offer the expressiv  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> ity of the interval-based systems as they only handle point-based relations. Of the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> three, TimeGraph-II offers a wider range of qualitative relations as it handles point  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> inequality. It does not currently handle metric information, however, as do TMM  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> and TimeGraph. Thus decisions between these three may be more determined by the  </abstract>::line_number::18

<title>  Utterance Units in Spoken Dialogue   </title>::line_number::0
<author>  David R. Traum 1 and Peter A. Heeman 2   </author>::line_number::1
<abstract>  Abstract. In order to make spoken dialogue systems more sophisticated, designers need to better understand the conventions that people  </abstract>::line_number::2
<abstract> use in structuring their speech and in interacting with their fellow con-versants. In particular, it is crucial to discriminate the basic building  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> blocks of dialogue and how they affect the way people process language. Many researchers have proposed the utterance unit as the  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> primary object of study, but defining exactly what this is has remained a difficult issue. To shed light on this question, we consider  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> grounding behavior in dialogue, and examine co-occurrences between  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> turn-initial grounding acts and utterance unit signals that have been  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> proposed in the literal, namely prosodic boundary tones and pauses.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Preliminary results indicate high correlation between grounding and  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> boundary tones, with a secondary correlation for longer pauses. We  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> also consider some of the dialogue processing issues which are impacted by a definition of utterance unit.   </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Bayesian inference begins with a prior distribution for model parameters that is  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> meant to capture prior beliefs about the relationship being modeled. For multilayer  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> perceptron networks, where the parameters are the connection weights, the prior  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> lacks any direct meaning | what matters is the prior over functions computed  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> by the network that is implied by this prior over weights. In this paper, I show  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> that priors over weights can be defined in such a way that the corresponding  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> priors over functions reach reasonable limits as the number of hidden units in the  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> network goes to infinity. When using such priors, there is thus no need to limit the  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> size of the network in order to avoid "overfitting". The infinite network limit also  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> provides insight into the properties of different priors. A Gaussian prior for hidden-to-output weights results in a Gaussian process prior for functions, which can be  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> smooth, Brownian, or fractional Brownian, depending on the hidden unit activation  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> function and the prior for input-to-hidden weights. Quite different effects can be  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> obtained using priors based on non-Gaussian stable distributions. In networks with  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> more than one hidden layer, a combination of Gaussian and non-Gaussian priors  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> appears most interesting.   </abstract>::line_number::24

<abstract> We first describe a hierarchical, generative model that can be  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> viewed as a non-linear generalisation of factor analysis and can  </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract> top-down, bottom-up and lateral connections. These connections  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> can be learned using simple rules that require only locally available information. We then show how to incorporate lateral connections into the generative model. The model extracts a sparse,  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> Several researchers have proposed modeling  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> temporally abstract actions in reinforcement  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> learning by the combination of a policy and a termination condition, which we refer to as an option. Value functions over options and models of  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> options can be learned using methods designed  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> for semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs).  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> However, all these methods require an option to  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> be executed to termination. In this paper we explore methods that learn about an option from  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> small fragments of experience consistent with  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> that option, even if the option itself is not executed. We call these methods intra-option learning methods because they learn from experience  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> within an option. Intra-option methods are sometimes much more efficient than SMDP methods because they can use off-policy temporal-difference mechanisms to learn simultaneously  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> about all the options consistent with an experience, not just the few that were actually executed. In this paper we present intra-option learning methods for learning value functions over options and for learning multi-time models of the  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> consequences of options. We present computational examples in which these new methods  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> learn much faster than SMDP methods and learn  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> effectively when SMDP methods cannot learn at  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> all. We also sketch a convergence proof for intra  </abstract>::line_number::31

<abstract> Design-to-time is an approach to problem-solving in resource-constrained domains where:  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> multiple solution methods are available for tasks, those solution methods make tradeoffs in  </abstract>::line_number::9

<abstract> The availability of low-cost computational power is a driving force behind the growing sophistication  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> of CAD software. Tools designed to reduce time-consuming build-test-redesign iterations are essential  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> for increasing engineering quality and productivity. However, automation of the design process poses  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> many difficult computational problems. As more downstream engineering activities are being considered  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> during the design phase, guaranteeing reasonable response times within design systems becomes problematic. Design is an interactive process and speed is a critical factor in systems that enable designers to  </abstract>::line_number::27

<abstract> an increasingly sophisticated allocation of computational resources in order to perform realistic design  </abstract>::line_number::29

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Traditional inter-domain routing protocols based on superdomains maintain either "strong"  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> or "weak" ToS and policy constraints for each visible superdomain. With strong constraints,  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> a valid path may not be found even though one exists. With weak constraints, an invalid  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> domain-level path may be treated as a valid path.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> We present an inter-domain routing protocol based on superdomains, which always finds  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> a valid path if one exists. Both strong and weak constraints are maintained for each visible  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> superdomain. If the strong constraints of the superdomains on a path are satisfied, then the  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> path is valid. If only the weak constraints are satisfied for some superdomains on the path, the  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> source uses a query protocol to obtain a more detailed "internal" view of these superdomains,  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> and searches again for a valid path. Our protocol handles topology changes, including node/link  </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> This paper presents a detailed comparison of the relative importance of allowing concurrent writers  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> versus the choice of the underlying consistency model. Our comparison is based on single- and multiple-writer versions of a lazy release consistent (LRC) protocol, and a single-writer sequentially consistent  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> protocol, all implemented in the CVM software distributed shared memory system.  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> We find that in our environment, which we believe to be representative of distributed systems today  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> and in the near future, the consistency model has a much higher impact on overall performance than the  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> choice of whether to allow concurrent writers. The multiple writer protocol performs an average of 9%  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> better than the single writer LRC protocol, but 34% better than the single-writer sequentially consistent  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> protocol. Set against this, MW-LRC required an average of 72% memory overhead, compared to 10%  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> overhead for the single-writer protocols.   </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> We propose a hybrid method for synthesis of hierarchical structured Petri nets. In a top-down manner, we decompose a system into a set of subsystems at each level of abstraction, each  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> of these is specified as a blackbox Petri net that has multiple inputs and outputs. We stipulate  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> that each subsystem satisfies the following I/O constraints: (1) At any instance of time, at  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> most one of the inputs can be activated; and (2) If one input is activated, then the subsystem  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> must consume the input and produce exactly one output within a finite length of time. We  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> give a stepwise refinement procedure which starts from the initial high-level abstraction of the  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> system and expands an internal place of a blackbox Petri net into a more detailed subnet at  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> each step. By enforcing the I/O constraints of each subsystem in each intermediate abstraction,  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> our refinement maintains the sequencing of transitions prescribed by the initial abstraction of  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> the system. Next, for the bottom-up synthesis, we present interconnection rules for sequential,  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> parallel, and loop structures and prove that each rule maintains the I/O constraints. Thus, by  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> incorporating these interconnection rules into our refinement formulation, our approach can be  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> regarded as a hybrid Petri net synthesis technique that employs both top-down and bottom-up  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> methods. The major advantage of the method is that the modeling details can be introduced  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> incrementally and naturally, while the important logical properties of the resulting Petri net are  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> guaranteed.   </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> We propose a new bandwidth allocation scheme for VBR video traffic in ATM networks.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> The scheme is tailored to MPEG-coded video sources that require stringent and deterministic  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> quality-of-service guarantees. By exploiting the temporal structure of MPEG sources, we show  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> that our scheme results in an effective bandwidth which, in most cases, is less than the source  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> peak rate. The reduction in the bandwidth requirement is achieved without sacrificing any  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> perceived QoS. Efficient procedures are provided for the computation of the effective bandwidth  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> under heterogeneous MPEG sources. The effective bandwidth strongly depends on the arrangement of the multiplexed streams which is a measure of the degree of synchronization between the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> GOP patterns of different streams. Assuming that all possible arrangements are equi-probable,  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> we derive an expression for the asymptotic tail distribution of the effective bandwidth. From  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> the tail distribution, we compute several performance measures for the call blocking probability  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> when the allocation is made based on the effective bandwidth. In the case of homogeneous  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> sources, we give a closed-form expression for the `best' arrangement that results in the `optimal'  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> effective bandwidth. Numerical examples based on real MPEG traces are used to demonstrate  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> the advantages of our scheme.   </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract>  Abstract: This paper presents an empirical study of several policies for managing the effect  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> of delay jitter on the playout of audio and video in computer-based conferences. The problem  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> addressed is that of managing the fundamental tradeoff between display with low latency and  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> display with few gaps. We describe a particular policy called queue monitoring which  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> observes delay jitter over time and dynamically adjusts display latency in order to support  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> low-latency conferences with an acceptable gap rate. Queue monitoring is evaluated by  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> comparing it with two policies from the literature in a study based on measurements from a  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> computer-based conferencing system. Our results show that queue monitoring performs as  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> well or better than the other policies over the range of observed network loads. More  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> importantly, we show that queue monitoring performs better on those network loads for  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> which the other policies exhibit poor performance.   </abstract>::line_number::18

<title>  Real-Time Computing with Lock-Free Shared Objects   </title>::line_number::0

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> This paper considers the use of lock-free shared objects  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> within hard real-time systems. As the name suggests,  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> lock-free shared objects are distinguished by the fact  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> that they are not locked. As such, they do not give  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> rise to priority inversions, a key advantage over conventional, lock-based object-sharing approaches. Despite this advantage, it is not immediately apparent  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> that lock-free shared objects can be employed if tasks  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> must adhere to strict timing constraints. In particular,  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> lock-free object implementations permit concurrent operations to interfere with each other, and repeated interferences can cause a given operation to take an arbitrarily long time to complete.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> The main contribution of this paper is to show that  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> such interferences can be bounded by judicious scheduling. This work pertains to periodic, hard real-time  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> tasks that share lock-free objects on a uniprocessor. In  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> the first part of the paper, scheduling conditions are derived for such tasks, for both static and dynamic priority schemes. Based on these conditions, it is formally  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> shown that lock-free object-sharing approaches can be  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> expected to incur much less overhead than approaches  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> based on wait-free objects or lock-based schemes. In  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> the last part of the paper, this conclusion is validated experimentally through work involving a real-time desktop videoconferencing system.   </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  ABSTRACT  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> Sync is a new Java-based framework for developing collaborative applications for wireless mobile  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> systems. Sync is based on objectoriented replication and offers high-level synchronization-aware classes  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> based on existing Java classes. Programmers may also extend the Sync-provided classes to create new  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> replicated classes, either to add functionality or to modify a classs merge policy. Sync supports fully  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> disconnected operation and employs centralized, asynchronous synchronization. Application programmers  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> use the Sync framework to define conflicts and specify conflict resolution on the basis of the applications  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> structure and semantics.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> We discuss the general needs of wireless mobile applications, and present a high-function example  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> application that would be useful to mobile users, to be used for illustration throughout the paper. Next we  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> discuss related work, and evaluate each work relative to its ability to support the example application. We  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> then present the Sync framework, motivating each feature with its use in the example application.   </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> The relation between the orthography and the phonology of a language has  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract> approaches offer a means to gather this knowledge automatically. Problems  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> arise when the training material is sparse. Generalising from sparse data  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> is a well-known problem for many ML algorithms. We present experiments  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> Many emerging applications (e.g., teleconference, real-time  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> information services, pay per view, distributed interactive  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> simulation, and collaborative work) are based upon a group  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> communications model, i.e., they require packet delivery  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> from one or more authorized senders to a very large number  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> of authorized receivers. As a result, securing group communications (i.e., providing confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages delivered between group members)  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> will become a critical networking issue.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> In this paper, we present a novel solution to the scalability problem of group/multicast key management. We  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> formalize the notion of a secure group as a triple (U; K; R)  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> where U denotes a set of users, K a set of keys held by the  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> users, and R a user-key relation. We then introduce key  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> graphs to specify secure groups. For a special class of key  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> graphs, we present three strategies for securely distributing rekey messages after a join/leave, and specify protocols  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> for joining and leaving a secure group. The rekeying strategies and join/leave protocols are implemented in a prototype  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> group key server we have built. We present measurement  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> results from experiments and discuss performance comparisons. We show that our group key management service, using any of the three rekeying strategies, is scalable to large  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> groups with frequent joins and leaves. In particular, the  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> average measured processing time per join/leave increases  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> linearly with the logarithm of group size.   </abstract>::line_number::25

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> Planning systems have become an important tool for automating a wide variety  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> of tasks. Control knowledge guides a planner to find solutions quickly and is crucial  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> for efficient planning in most domains. Machine learning techniques enable a planning  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> system to automatically acquire domain-specific search-control knowledge for different  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> applications. Past approaches to learning control information have usually employed  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> explanation-based learning (EBL) to generate control rules. Unfortunately, EBL alone  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> often produces overly complex rules that actually decrease rather than improve overall  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> planning efficiency. This paper presents a novel learning approach for control knowledge  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> acquisition that integrates explanation-based learning with techniques from inductive  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> logic programming. In our learning system Scope, EBL is used to constrain an inductive search for control heuristics that help a planner choose between competing plan  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> refinements. Scope is one of the few systems to address learning control information for newer, partial-order planners. Specifically, this proposal describes how Scope  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> learns domain-specific control rules for the UCPOP planning algorithm. The resulting  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> system is shown to produce significant speedup in two different planning domains, and  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> to be more effective than a pure EBL approach. Future research will be performed  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> in three main areas. First, Scope's learning algorithm will be extended to include  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> additional techniques such as constructive induction and rule utility analysis. Second,  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> Scope will be more thoroughly tested; several real-world planning domains have been  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> identified as possible testbeds, and more in-depth comparisons will be drawn between  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> Scope and other competing approaches. Third, Scope will be implemented in a different planning system in order to test its portability to other planning algorithms. This  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> work should demonstrate that machine-learning techniques can be a powerful tool in  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> the quest for tractable real-world planning.   </abstract>::line_number::31

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Nested loop execution of object-oriented queries retains  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> the promise of maintaining the full generality of the object paradigm, independent of the specifics of any single  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> object model. Thus, from this starting point we have  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> developed an object-oriented query optimizer and execution engine. The methods, developed to date for only  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> acyclic queries, augment nested loops structures with a  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> simple marking mechanism such that unnecessary loop  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> iterations are not repeated. In the case of acyclic queries,  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> the executions are asymptotically optimal. In contrast to  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> optimal query methods based on semijoin reductions our  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> method involves no preprocessing step and thus avoids  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> the extra I/O associated with semijoins and prevents the  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> formal benefits of semijoin reduction from appearing as a  </abstract>::line_number::20

<author> Raymond R. Wagner, Jr.   </author>::line_number::3
<abstract>  Abstract We introduce a class of networks called isotach networks designed to reduce the  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> cost of concurrency control in asynchronous computations. Isotach networks support several  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> properties important to the correct execution of parallel and distributed computations: atomi-city, causal message delivery, sequential consistency, and memory coherence in systems in  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> which shared data can replicate and migrate. They allow processes to execute atomic actions  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> without locks and to pipeline memory accesses without sacrificing sequential consistency. Iso-tach networks can be implemented in a wide variety of configurations, including NUMA (nonuniform memory access) multiprocessors and distributed as well as parallel systems. Networks  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> that implement isotach time systems are characterized not by their topology, but by the guarantees they make about the relative order in which messages appear to be delivered. These  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> guarantees are expressed in logical time, not physical time. Physical time guarantees would be  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> prohibitively expensive, whereas logical time guarantees can be enforced cheaply, using purely  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> local knowledge, and yet are powerful enough to support efficient techniques for coordinating  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> asynchronously executing processes. Empirical and analytic studies of isotach systems show  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> that they outperform conventional systems under realistic workloads, in some cases by an order  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract> In computer systems with large, physically-indexed,  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> direct-mapped caches, a poor mapping from virtual to  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> physical pages causes excessive cache conflict misses.  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> In a previous paper we proposed a simple hardware device, the Cache Miss Lookaside (CML) Buffer, which  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> identifies pages that are suffering from conflict misses.  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> The operating system can use this information to implement a dynamic page mapping policy that resolves  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> conflicts by performing an in-memory copy of one of  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> the conflicting pages, and updating the virtual to physical mappings. In this paper, we propose several dynamic page mapping policies that detect and resolve  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> cache conflicts using hardware available in existing systems, such as a TLB and cache miss counter, to locate  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> possible cache conflicts. We evaluate the simulated  </abstract>::line_number::31
<abstract> performance of a variety of mapping policies, and show  </abstract>::line_number::32
<abstract> that a dynamic page mapping policy using standard  </abstract>::line_number::33

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> User-level threads have performance and flexibility advantages over both Unix-like processes  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> and kernel threads. However, the performance of user-level threads may suffer in multipro-grammed environments, or when threads block in the kernel (e.g., for I/O). These problems  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> can be particularly severe in tasks that communicate frequently using IPC (e.g., multithreaded  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> servers), due to interactions between the user-level thread scheduler and the operating system  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> IPC primitives. Efficient IPC typically involves processor handoff that blocks the caller and  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> unblocks a thread in the callee; when combined with user-level threads, this can cause problems  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> for both caller and callee, particularly if the caller thread should subsequently block.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> In this paper we describe a new user-level thread package, called OThreads, designed to  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> support blocking and efficient IPC for a system based on traditional kernel threads. We discuss  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> the extent to which these problems can be solved at the user level without kernel changes  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> such as scheduler activations. Our conclusion is that problems caused by application-controlled  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> We present a new method for accelerating walkthroughs of geometrically complex static  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> scenes. As a preprocessing step, our method constructs a BSP-tree that hierarchically partitions the geometric primitives in the scene. In the course of a walkthrough, images of nodes  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> at various levels of the hierarchy are cached for reuse in subsequent frames. A cached image is applied as a texture map to a single quadrilateral that is drawn instead of the geometry  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> contained in the corresponding node. Visual artifacts are kept under control by using an error metric that quantifies the discrepancy between the appearance of the geometry contained  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> in a node and the cached image. The new method is shown to achieve significant speedups  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> for a walkthrough of a complex outdoor scene, with little or no loss in rendering quality.   </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract> Subdivision surfaces provide a curved surface representation that is useful in a number of applications, including modeling surfaces of arbitrary topological type [5] , fitting scattered data [6] , and geometric compression  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> and automatic level-of-detail generation using wavelets [8] . Subdivision surfaces also provide an attractive representation for fast rendering, since they can directly represent complex surfaces of arbitrary topology. This direct  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> representation contrasts with traditional approaches such as trimmed NURBS, in which tesselating trim regions  </abstract>::line_number::9

<abstract> other computationally expensive techniques.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> We present a method for subdivision surface triangulation that is fast, uses minimum memory, and is simpler in  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> structure than a naive rendering method based on direct subdivision. These features make the algorithm amenable  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> We present an approach for recovering surface shape from the occluding contour using an active (i.e., moving) observer. It is based on a relation between the geometries of  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> a surface in a scene and its occluding contour: If the viewing direction of the observer  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> is along a principal direction for a surface point whose projection is on the contour,  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> surface shape (i.e., curvature) at the surface point can be recovered from the contour.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Unlike previous approaches for recovering shape from the occluding contour, we use an  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> observer that purposefully changes viewpoint in order to achieve a well-defined geometric relationship with respect to a 3D shape prior to its recognition. We show that there  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> is a simple and efficient viewing strategy that allows the observer to align their viewing  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> direction with one of the two principal directions for a point on the surface. This strategy depends on only curvature measurements on the occluding contour and therefore  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> demonstrates that recovering quantitative shape information from the contour does not  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> require knowledge of the velocities or accelerations of the observer. Experimental results  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> In an effort to push the envelope of system performance, microprocessor designs are continually exploiting higher levels of  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> instruction-level parallelism, resulting in increasing bandwidth demands on the address translation mechanism. Most current microprocessor designs meet this demand with a multi-ported TLB. While  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> this design provides an excellent hit rate at each port, its access latency and area grow very quickly as the number of ports is increased.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> As bandwidth demands continue to increase, multi-ported designs  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> will soon impact memory access latency.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> We present four high-bandwidth address translation mechanisms  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> with latency and area characteristics that scale better than a multi-ported TLB design. We extend traditional high-bandwidth memory  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> design techniques to address translation, developing interleaved and  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> multi-level TLB designs. In addition, we introduce two new designs  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> crafted specifically for high-bandwidth address translation. Piggyback ports are introduced as a technique to exploit spatial locality in  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> simultaneous translation requests, allowing accesses to the same virtual memory page to combine their requests at the TLB access port.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> Pretranslation is introduced as a technique for attaching translations  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> to base register values, making it possible to reuse a single translation many times.  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> We perform extensive simulation-based studies to evaluate our  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> designs. We vary key system parameters, such as processor model,  </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract> This report presents results of a peer review of MQPs conducted within  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the Computer Science Department during the Summer of 1995 as part of a  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> campus-wide MQP review. The goal of the report is to assess whether the  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> In this paper, syntactic parsing is discussed in the context of connectionism. A new model - the Confluent  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Preorder Parser (CPP), is proposed which exemplifies the holistic parsing paradigm. Holistic parsing has the  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> advantage that little assumption has to be made concerning the detailed parsing algorithm, which is often  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> unknown or debatable, especially when human language understanding is concerned. In the CPP, syntactic  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> parsing is achieved by transforming in a oneshot manner, from the connectionist representation of the sentence  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> to the connectionist representation of the preorder traversal of its parse tree, instead of the parse tree itself. As  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> revealed by the simulation experiments, generalization performance is excellent (as high as 90%). Besides, the  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> CPP is also capable of parsing erroneous sentences and resolving syntactic ambiguities. A systematic study is  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> conducted to explore the range of factors which can affect the effectiveness of it. This error-recovery capability  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> is especially useful in natural language processing when incomplete or even ungrammatical sentences are to be  </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The graph topo-visual formalism has been shown to  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> be well-suited to the task of visualizing complex relations on a set of elements. Unfortunately, most visual  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> formalisms do not scale very well. This observation is  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> particularly true of graphs, which even when hand-drawn  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> by an artist, are seldom meaningful when the number of  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> nodes or links exceeds a very modest threshold typically only a few hundred elements. This severe limitation  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> has prompted many researchers to seek alternative visualization techniques that may eliminate, or, at the very  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> least, raise this threshold.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> In this paper we analyze these recent efforts, describe  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> an abstract space of presentation emphasis techniques,  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> and locate the current approaches within this space. The  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> contributions of this paper are several: (1) a significant  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> portion of recent work is collected and reviewed; (2) a  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> common set of criteria and a taxonomy of graph views  </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract> verification of complex systems can be exploited for a reliable and well  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> documented development of executable, but formally inspectable and  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> systematically modifiable code. A hierarchy of stepwise refined abstract  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> machine models is developed, the ground version of which can be checked  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> for whether it faithfully reflects the informally given problem. The sequence of machine models yields various abstract views of the system,  </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract> The abstract machines are evolving algebras and thereby have a rigorous  </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Drawing on on our work in the area of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, we propose the rudiments of a view of multiagent reasoning that relates current philosophical  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> intuitions, theoretical foundations, and preliminary implementation. The philosophical  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> position we take is a combination of Daniel Dennett's philosophy of the ladder of per-sonhood (consisting of rationality, intentionality, stance, reciprocity, communication,  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> and consciousness) on one hand, and the utilitarian philosophy of selfish utility maximization on the other hand. The theories we incorporate are logics of knowledge and  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> belief, which in addressing the multiagent issues can be developed based on a recursive  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> version of the Kripke structure, and the related fields of utility, decision and game  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> theories. Our preliminary implementation, the Recursive Modeling Method (RMM),  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> lets an agent coordinate its actions with the actions of other agents, cooperate with  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> them when appropriate, and rationally choose an optimal form of communication with  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> them.   </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> We describe a flexible experimental testbed, called MICE, for distributed artificial intelligence  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> research. We argue that the adoption of MICE (or some other standard testbed) by the distributed  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> artificial intelligence community can draw together the community and permit a much greater level  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> of exchange of ideas, formalisms, and techniques. MICE allows an experimenter to specify the  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> constraints and characteristics of an environment in which agents are simulated to act and interact,  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> and does not assume any particular implementation of an agent's reasoning architecture. MICE  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> therefore provides a platform for investigating and evaluating alternative reasoning architectures  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> and coordination mechanisms in many different simulated environments. We outline the design  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> of MICE and illustrate its flexibility by describing simulated environments that model the coordination issues in domains such as predators chasing prey, predators attacking each other, agents  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> fighting a fire, and diverse robots that are working together. In addition, we note that MICE's  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> ability to simulate multi-agent environments makes it an ideal platform for studying reasoning in  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> dynamic worlds; we can associate functionality to arbitrary objects in order to trigger changes in  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> the environment. We conclude by discussing the status of MICE and how we are using MICE in  </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract> Efficient path computation necessary for route guidance has been identified as one of the key requirements  </abstract>::line_number::10

<abstract> the application of search algorithms (typically, heuristic A* algorithms) to provide for compute-on-demand  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract> we present algorithms for incrementally updating the encoded path view structure in response to weight  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> changes on the traffic links of the underlying network. Despite non-optimal paths also being materialized, our  </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract> by presenting experimental results of evaluating our approach both on randomly generated as well as on real  </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract> corresponds to a group planning process. We  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> here introduce a new multi-agent planning  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> technique, that makes use of a dynamic, iterative search procedure. Through a process of  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> group constraint aggregation, agents incrementally construct a plan that brings the group to  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> a state maximizing social welfare. At each step,  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> agents vote about the next joint action in the  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> group plan (i.e., what the next transition state  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> will be in the emerging plan). Using this technique agents need not fully reveal their preferences, and the set of alternative final states  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> need not be generated in advance of a vote.  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> With a minor variation, the entire procedure  </abstract>::line_number::26

<abstract> Formal technical review (FTR) is an essential component of all modern software quality assessment, assurance,  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> and improvement techniques, and is acknowledged to be  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the most cost-effective form of quality improvement when  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> practiced effectively. However, traditional FTR methods  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> such as inspection are very difficult to adopt in organizations: they introduce substantial new up-front costs,  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> training, overhead, and group process obstacles. Sustained commitment from high-level management along  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> with substantial resources is often necessary for successful  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> technology transfer of FTR.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> Since 1991, we have been designing and evaluating  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> a series of versions of a system called CSRS: an instrumented, computer-supported cooperative work environment for formal technical review. The current version of  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> CSRS includes an FTR method definition language, which  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> allows organizations to design their own FTR method,  </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> The algebraic structure of combinatory differential fields is constructed to provide a semantics for computations in analysis. In this setting programs, approximations, limits and operations of analysis are represented  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> as algebraic terms. Analytic algorithms can be derived by algebraic methods. The main tool in this construction are combinatory models which are inner algebras of Engeler graph models. As an universal domain  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> of denotational semantics the lattice structure of the graph models allows to give a striking simple semantics  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> for computations with approximations. As models of combinatory algebra they provide all essential computational constructs, including recursion. Combinatory models are constructed as extensions of first order  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> theories. The classical first order theory to describe analysis is the theory of differential fields. It turns out  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> that two types of computational constructs, namely composition and piecewise definition of functions, are  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> preferably introduced as extensions of the differential fields theory. Combinatory differential fields are then  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> the combinatory models of these enriched differential fields. We show for basic algorithms of computational  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> analysis how their combinatory counterparts are derived in the algebraic setting. We illustrate how these  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> algorithms are suitable to be implemented in a computer algebra environment like mathematica.   </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> This paper attempts to exemplify the advantages of perceptually grounded semantics with respect to traditional formalist approaches in elucidating the nature of the  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> controversial notion of linguistic polysemy, or multiplicity of meaning. It is also suggested how some aspects of language typically associated with compositionality could  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> be modeled, without there being a strictly "compositional semantics".  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> This is done through a series of experiments, using modifications of Terry Regier's  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> connectionist system for learning spatial relations [Regier, 1992] which constitutes a  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> part of the L 0 project concerned with associating descriptions in an arbitrary language  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> with an analog environment, (sequences of) pictures of simple 2-dimensional scenes.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> The emphasis is above all on the English preposition `over', famous for its poly-semy, and analyzed in detail by [Brugman, 1981] and [Lakoff, 1987], but some modeling has been also done of the meaning of `under', as well as some rudimentary  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract> We present algorithms for the randomized simulation of a shared memory machine  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> (PRAM) on a Distributed Memory Machine (DMM). In a PRAM, memory conflicts  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> occur only through concurrent access to the same cell, whereas the memory of a  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> DMM is divided into modules, one for each processor, and concurrent accesses to  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> the same module create a conflict. The delay of a simulation is the time needed to  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> simulate a parallel memory access of the PRAM. Any general simulation of an m  </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> We study the problem of sorting on a parallel computer with limited communication  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> bandwidth. By using the recently proposed PRAM(m) model, where p processors  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> communicate through a small, globally shared memory consisting of m bits, we focus  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> on the trade-off between the amount of local computation and the amount of inter-processor communication required for parallel sorting algorithms. We prove a lower  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> bound of ( n log m  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> m ) on the time to sort n numbers in an exclusive-read variant of  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> the PRAM(m) model. We show that Leighton's Columnsort can be used to give  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> an asymptotically matching upper bound in the case where m grows as a fractional  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> power of n. The bounds are of a surprising form, in that they have little dependence  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> on the parameter p. This implies that attempting to distribute the workload across  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> more processors while holding the problem size and the size of the shared memory  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> fixed will not improve the optimal running time of sorting in this model. We also  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> show that both the upper and the lower bound can be adapted to bridging models  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> that address the issue of limited communication bandwidth: the LogP model and  </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract> The burstiness of variable bit rate traffic makes it difficult to both efficiently utilize network resources and provide end-to-end network performance guarantees to the traffic sources.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Generally, smoothing or shaping traffic sources at the entrance of the network reduces their  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> burstiness to allow higher utilization within the network. However, this buffering introduces  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> an additional delay so that, in effect, lossless smoothing trades queueing delay inside the  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> network for smoothing delay at the network edge. In this paper, we consider the net effect  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> of smoothing on end-to-end performance guarantees where a no-loss, no-delay-violation deterministic guarantee is provided with the D-BIND traffic model. We analytically quantify  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> these tradeoffs and provide a set of general rules for determining under which conditions  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> smoothing provides a net gain. We also empirically investigate these tradeoffs using traces  </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> For slotted networks carrying full multi-media traffic to work successfully, it is essential that connection setup and management is done well under all traffic conditions.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> Major challenges remain with the current state of the technology, however, particularly on how one copes with traffic bursts. Existing reservation-based networks do not  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> allow the user to dynamically adjust his bandwidth requirements on demand. In this  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> paper we propose a new scheme, called the reservoir scheme, which allows dynamic  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> and distributed resource allocation. The basic idea behind the scheme is to reserve  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> bandwidth with a guaranteed bit rate for each virtual circuit. The user is allowed to  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> decentrally allocate additional bandwidth from an Available Bit Rate (ABR) reservoir to satisfy dynamic changes of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic. The duration and  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> bandwidth of this dynamic access are negotiated in the call setup phase and do not  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> require any renegotiation with the service provider so that this solution overcomes the  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> rigidity of current static bandwidth reservation schemes. The additional management  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> requirements are low compared to other dynamic bandwidth reservation schemes. We  </abstract>::line_number::24

<abstract> Technological progress has made providing numerous new services to large number  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> of users possible. Concurrently, we also experience an increased interest in real-time  </abstract>::line_number::9

<abstract> sharing, in particular, because of the worldwide and decentralized character of today's  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> research and development organizations.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> The International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) is a participant of the first  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> transatlantic ATM link which is an integral part of the Multimedia Applications  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> on Intercontinental Highways (MAY) Project. Additionally, ICSI is attached to the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> Bay Area Gigabit Network (BAGNet) providing ATM connectivity at the best-effort  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> basis. Both projects provide platforms to identify the key research and development  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> topics in cooperative real-time communication.  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> The technical report gives a brief introduction to the ATM infrastructure at ICSI and  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> addresses challenging management issues of multimedia applications in such global  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> area ATM networks. We explore three management areas: performance, configuration,  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> and fault management with respect to the user's point of view. Finally, we introduce  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> a management platform and tools we have been developing which help the user to  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> better predict the quality of service provided and to recover from faults occurred in  </abstract>::line_number::24

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> At the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), there is an ongoing effort  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> to gain experience on ATM and multi-media applications. ICSI is participating in  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> two ATM pilots called Bay Area Gigabit Network (BAGNet) and Multimedia Applications on Intercontinental Highway (MAY). Beside these wide-area trial ICSI's  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> ATM network is used for local multi-media experiments. The ATM environment at  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> ICSI is heterogeneous. Both, local and long distance traffic is based on permanent  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> virtual connections. The management of this environment has often been cumbersome and time-consuming for a number of reasons: The ATM devices have to be  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> accessed separately in an unintegrated manner. Different vendor-specific tools with  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> different user interfaces are used. Configuration data is stored unstructured, redundant and not centralized. Users cannot setup or verify a connection without knowing  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> device-specific details. Hence, the need for a software tool arose that can minimize the  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> administrative work spent on connection management. This technical report contains  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> my master's thesis which is about the design and implementation of TOMCAD a  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> tool for monitoring and configuration of ATM devices. Being a web-based software  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> tool it can support local and wide-area connectivity and provide access for local and  </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> Two key issues for induction algorithms are the accuracy of the learned hypothesis and the computational  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> resources consumed in inducing that hypothesis. One  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> of the most promising ways to improve performance  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> along both dimensions is to make use of additional  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> knowledge. Multi-strategy learning algorithms tackle  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> this problem by employing several strategies for handling different kinds of knowledge in different ways.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> However, integrating knowledge into an induction algorithm can be difficult when the new knowledge differs significantly from the knowledge the algorithm  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> already uses. In many cases the algorithm must be  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> rewritten.  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> This paper presents KII, a Knowledge Integration  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> framework for Induction, that provides a uniform  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> mechanism for integrating knowledge into induction.  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> In theory, arbitrary knowledge can be integrated with  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> this mechanism, but in practice the knowledge representation language determines both the knowledge  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> that can be integrated, and the costs of integration  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> and induction. By instantiating KII with various set  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> representations, algorithms can be generated at different trade-off points along these dimensions.  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> One instantiation of KII, called RS-KII, is presented  </abstract>::line_number::31
<abstract> that can implement hybrid induction algorithms, depending on which knowledge it utilizes. RS-KII is  </abstract>::line_number::32
<abstract> demonstrated to implement AQ-11 (Michalski 1978),  </abstract>::line_number::33
<abstract> as well as a hybrid algorithm that utilizes a domain  </abstract>::line_number::34
<abstract> theory and noisy examples. Other algorithms are also  </abstract>::line_number::35
<abstract> possible.   </abstract>::line_number::36

<abstract> domain knowledge. HIA has two building blocks, a Rule-Based module and a Connectionist Architecture  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> module. A specific format for the rule-based description of the initial theory acquired from the application  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> domain enables its mapping into a uniform, three layer network. Continuous inputs are discretized into  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> input vectors using a new coarse coding scheme. An extension of the Backpropagation Algorithm allows  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> refinement of the discretization functions. A successful application to the control of dams on the Colorado  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract> also dramatically increases their generality and  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract> addition, a variety of differing problem formulations are investigated and the relative probability  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> This paper describes an efficient optimistic concurrency control  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> scheme for use in distributed database systems in which objects are  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> cached and manipulated at client machines while persistent storage  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> and transactional support are provided by servers. The scheme  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> provides both serializability and external consistency for committed  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> transactions; it uses loosely synchronized clocks to achieve global  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> serialization. It stores only a single version of each object, and  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> avoids maintaining any concurrency control information on a per-  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> object basis; instead, it tracks recent invalidations on a per-client  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> basis, an approach that has low in-memory space overhead and no  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> per-object disk overhead. In addition to its low space overheads,  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> the scheme also performs well. The paper presents a simulation  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> study that compares the scheme to adaptive callback locking, the  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> best concurrency control scheme for client-server object-oriented  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> database systems studied to date. The study shows that our  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> scheme outperforms adaptive callback locking for low to moderate  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> contention workloads, and scales better with the number of clients.  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> For high contention workloads, optimism can result in a high abort  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> rate; the scheme presented here is a first step toward a hybrid scheme  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> that we expect to perform well across the full range of workloads.   </abstract>::line_number::28

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> A non-greedy approach for constructing globally optimal  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> multivariate decision trees with fixed structure is proposed. Previous greedy tree construction algorithms are  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> locally optimal in that they optimize some splitting criterion at each decision node, typically one node at a time.  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> In contrast, global tree optimization explicitly considers  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> all decisions in the tree concurrently. An iterative linear  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> programming algorithm is used to minimize the classification error of the entire tree. Global tree optimization  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> can be used both to construct decision trees initially and  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> to update existing decision trees. Encouraging computational experience is reported.   </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> Generating language that reflects the temporal organization of represented knowledge requires a language generation model that integrates contemporary theories of tense and aspect, temporal representations, and methods  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> to plan text. This paper presents a model  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> that produces complex sentences that reflect  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> temporal relations present in underlying temporal concepts. The main result of this work  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> is the successful application of constrained linguistic theories of tense and aspect to a generator which produces meaningful event combinations and selects appropriate connecting words  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> that relate them.   </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract>  Abstract. In this paper we present one aspect of our research on machine translation (MT):  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> capturing the grammatical and computational relation between (i) the interlingua (IL) as defined  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> declaratively in the lexicon and (ii) the IL as defined procedurally by way of algorithms that  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> compose and decompose pivot IL forms. We begin by examining the interlinguas in the lexicons of  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> a variety of current IL-based approaches to MT. This brief survey makes it clear that no consensus  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> exists among MT researchers on the level of representation for defining the IL. In the section that  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> follows, we explore the consequences of this missing formal framework for MT system builders who  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> develop their own lexical-IL entries. The lack of software tools to support rapid IL respecification  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> and testing greatly hampers their ability to modify representations to handle new data and new  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> domains. Our view is that IL-based MT research needs both (a) the formal framework to specify  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> possible IL grammars and (b) the software support tools to implement and test these grammars.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> With respect to (a), we propose adopting a lexicalized grammar approach, tapping research  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> results from the study of tree grammars for natural language syntax. With respect to (b), we  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> sketch the design and functional specifications for parts of ILustrate, the set of software tools  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> that we need to implement and test the various IL formalisms that meet the requirements of a  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> lexicalized grammar. In this way, we begin to address a basic issue in MT research, how to define  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> and test an interlingua as a computational language | without building a full MT system for  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> each possible IL formalism that might be proposed.   </abstract>::line_number::24

<abstract> in multimodal systems which support human-computer interaction (HCI) via several input/output  </abstract>::line_number::6

<abstract> In this paper, we will deal with a multi-agent system which introduces some kind of haptic feedback  </abstract>::line_number::9

<abstract> the haptic feedback selectively and to adapt this capability over time to both, the user's behavior  </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> The problem of scheduling two classes of real-time traffic with correlated time constraints  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> is considered. Three scheduling disciplines are studied: a priority discipline which gives strict  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> priority to one class of traffic, a threshold-based scheme in which priority is given to one class  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> of traffic when the minimum laxity of its queued packets falls below some threshold, and a  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> "balancing" scheme which assigns priority on the basis of the differences in minimum laxities in  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> the two classes of traffic. Analytic results are obtained by using a discrete time model to obtain  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> the state occupancy probabilities for the system. Here, the state is defined using the laxities of  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> the queued real time packets. Parameters are defined to study the tradeoff in the performance  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> of the two classes of traffic. Results are obtained to demonstrate how the balancing scheme  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> permits us to achieve significant improvement in the performance of one class of traffic with  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> only minimal effect on the performance of other class. A video application is suggested for this  </abstract>::line_number::21

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Real-Time reliable multicast over a best-effort service network remains a challenging research problem. Most  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> protocols for reliable multicast use repair techniques that result in significant and variable delay, which can lead to  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> missed deadlines in real-time scenarios. This paper presents a repair technique that combines forward error correction  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> (FEC) with automatic repeat request (ARQ). The novel aspect of the technique is its ability to reduce delay in reliable  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> multicast delivery by sending repairs proactively (i.e., before they are required). The technique requires minimal  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> state at senders and receivers, and no additional active router functionality beyond what is required by the current  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> multicast service model. Furthermore, the technique uses only end-to-end mechanisms, where all data and repairs are  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> transmitted by the data-originating source, leaving receivers free from any burden of sending repairs. We simulate  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> a simple round-based version of a protocol embodying this technique to show its effectiveness in preventing repair  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> request implosion, reducing the expected time of reliable delivery of data, and keeping bandwidth usage for repairs  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> low. We show how a protocol using the technique can be adapted to provide delivery that is reliable before a real-time  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> deadline with probabilities extremely close to one. Finally, we develop several variations of the protocol that use the  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> technique in various fashions for high rate data streaming applications, and present results from additional simulations  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> that examine performance in a variety of Internet-like heterogeneous networks.   </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> Techniques for avoiding the high memory overheads found on  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> many modern shared-memory multiprocessors are of increasing  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> importance in the development of high-performance multiprocessor protocol implementations. One such technique is processor-cache affinity scheduling, which can significantly lower packet  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> latency and substantially increase protocol processing throughput  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> [20]. In this paper, we evaluate several aspects of the effectiveness of affinity-based scheduling in multiprocessor network  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> protocol processing, under packet-level and connection-level par-allelization approaches. Specifically, we evaluate the performance  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> of the scheduling technique 1) when a large number of streams are  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> concurrently supported, 2) when processing includes copying of  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> uncached packet data, 3) as applied to send-side protocol processing, and 4) in the presence of stream burstiness and source locality, two well-known properties of network traffic. We find that  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> affinity-based scheduling performs well under these conditions,  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> emphasizing its robustness and general effectiveness in multiprocessor network processing. In addition, we explore a technique  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> which improves the caching behavior and available packet-level  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> concurrency under connection-level parallelism, and find performance improves dramatically.   </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> The loss probability of a queueing system provides, in many cases, insufficient information for performance evaluation, for example, of data link layer protocols and applications with forward  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> error correction.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> This paper evaluates and characterizes the correlation between packet losses for two queueing systems in discrete time  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> that are motivated by BISDN applications. The first, a two-class discrete-time queueing system, approximates the output  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> queue of an ATM switch. The queue serves periodic foreground  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> traffic and random background traffic. The background traffic  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> is modeled as i.i.d. batches of arbitrary distribution. It is shown  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> that the conditional loss probability (CLP) is independent of the  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> buffer size if the buffer size is at least as large as the period of  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> the foreground traffic. Example calculations indicate that losses  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> occur essentially randomly as long as the foreground traffic uses  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> less than 10% of the channel capacity.  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> The second analysis derives the CLP seen by a selected  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> stream in a slotted finite-buffer system with a superposition of  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> interrupted Poisson sources. Here, the total number of arrivals  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> may be correlated from slot to slot. Traffic correlation is seen  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> to have a strong influence on loss correlation, while buffer size  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> is seen to have virtually none.   </abstract>::line_number::24

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> VBR compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple-time-scale bit rate variability. In this paper, we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> high speed network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most effectively toward  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> reducing the variability of the transmitted bit rate.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> We present two basic results. First, we show how to achieve the greatest possible reduction in  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> rate variability when sending stored video to a client with given buffer size. We formally establish  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> the optimality of our optimal smoothing approach, and illustrate its performance over a set of  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> long MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing on the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> network resources needed for video transport, under two network service models: Deterministic  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> Guaranteed service [1, 11] and Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service [9, 8]. Under both models, we  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract. Domain or background knowledge is often needed in order  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> to solve difficult problems of learning medical diagnostic rules. Earlier  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> experiments have demonstrated the utility of background knowledge  </abstract>::line_number::8

<abstract> paper explores the possibility to automate the process of acquiring background knowledge of this kind. A method based on function decomposition is proposed that identifies typical co-occurrences for a given set  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> of attributes. The method is evaluated by comparing the typical co-occurrences it identifies, as well as their contribution to the performance  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> This paper presents methods that make it possible to efficiently support irregular problems using data  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> parallel languages. The approach involves the use of a portable, compiler-independent, runtime support  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> library called CHAOS. The CHAOS runtime support library contains procedures that  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> * support static and dynamic distributed array partitioning,  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> * partition loop iterations and indirection arrays,  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> * remap arrays from one distribution to another, and  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> * carry out index translation, buffer allocation and communication schedule generation.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> The CHAOS runtime procedures are used by a prototype Fortran 90D compiler as runtime support for irregular problems. This paper also presents performance results of compiler-generated and  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> hand-parallelized versions of two stripped down applications codes. The first code is derived from  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> an unstructured mesh computational fluid dynamics flow solver and the second is derived from the  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> molecular dynamics code CHARMM.  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> A method is described that makes it possible to emulate irregular distributions in HPF by reordering elements of data arrays and renumbering indirection arrays. The results suggest that an HPF  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> compiler could use reordering and renumbering extrinsic functions to obtain performance comparable  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> to that achieved by a compiler for a language (such as Fortran 90D) that directly supports irregular  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> distributions.   </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract> can be interpreted as the ability of organisms to extract energy from potential food  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract> algorithm is that of developing systems which exhibit a certain type of behavior in a  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> particular environment, the fitness formula becomes an independent variable which can  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> be manipulated in order to obtain the desired behavior. The fitness formula can be  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> viewed as an evolvable trait of organisms, and therefore not fixed and decided by the  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> This paper advocates the idea that the physical modularity (file structure) of application components supported by conventional OS environments can be elevated to the level of logical modularity, which in turn  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> can directly support application development in an  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> object-oriented manner. We demonstrate this idea  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> through a system-wide server that manages the manipulation of such components effectively. The server  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> is designed to be a fundamental operating system service responsible for binding and mapping component  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> instances into client address spaces.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> We show how this model solves some longstanding  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> problems with the management of application components in existing application development environments. We demonstrate that this model's effectiveness derives from its support for the cornerstones of  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> In this paper we introduce a general method for Bayesian computing in richly-parameterized  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> models, Structured Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC), that is based on a blocked hybrid of the  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. SMCMC speeds algorithm convergence by  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> using the structure that is present in the problem to suggest an appropriate Metropolis-Hastings  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> candidate distribution. While the approach is easiest to describe for hierarchical normal linear  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> models, we show its extension to both non-normal and nonlinear cases to be straightforward.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> After describing the method in detail we compare its performance (both in terms of runtime and  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> autocorrelation in the samples produced) to several other existing methods, including the traditional  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> single-site updating Gibbs sampler available in the popular BUGS software package. Our results  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract> Most of the solutions proposed to support real-time (i.e. guaranteed performance) communication services in packet-switching networks adopt a connection-oriented and reservation-oriented approach. In such an approach, resource allocation  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> and route selection decisions are made before the start of the communication on the basis of resource availability and real-time network load at that time, and are usually kept for the duration of the communication. This rather static resource  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> management approach has certain limitations: it does not take into account (a) the dynamics of the communicating clients;  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> (b) the dynamics of the network state; and (c) the tradeoff between quality of service and network availability, thus affecting  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> the availability and flexibility of the real-time network services. Availability is the ability of the network to accommodate  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> as many real-time clients as possible, while flexibility is the ability to adapt the real-time services to changing network state  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> and client demands. In this paper, we present the Dynamic Connection Management (DCM) scheme, which addresses these  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> issues by providing the network with the capability to dynamically modify the performance parameters and the routes of  </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> We examine the estimation of selectivities for range and spatial join queries in real spatial  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> databases. As we have shown earlier [FK94a], real point sets: (a) violate consistently the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> "uniformity" and "independence" assumptions, (b) can often be described as "fractals", with  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> non-integer (fractal) dimension. In this paper we show that, among the infinite family of fractal  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> dimensions, the so called "Correlation Dimension" D 2 is the one that we need to predict the  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> selectivity of spatial join.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> The main contribution is that, for all the real and synthetic point-sets we tried, the average  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> number of neighbors for a given point of the point-set follows a power law, with D 2 as the exponent. This immediately solves the selectivity estimation for spatial joins, as well as for "biased"  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> range queries (i.e., queries whose centers prefer areas of high point density).  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> We present the formulas to estimate the selectivity for the biased queries, including an integration constant (K `shape 0 ) for each query shape. Finally, we show results on real and synthetic  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> point sets, where our formulas achieve very low relative errors (typically about 10%, versus  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> 40%-100% of the uniform assumption).   </abstract>::line_number::25

<abstract> Graphical techniques for modeling the dependencies of random variables have been explored in a variety  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> of different areas including statistics, statistical physics, artificial intelligence, speech recognition, image  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> processing, and genetics. Formalisms for manipulating these models have been developed relatively  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract> and related structures within the general framework of probabilistic independence networks (PINs). The  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> paper contains a self-contained review of the basic principles of PINs. It is shown that the well-known  </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> Three dimensional visualisation has become a  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> widespread scheme for helping users to access  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> and manage large information network. In this  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> report, various techniques for displaying depth  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> information are reviewed, with an emphasis on  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> stereoscopic displays. Input devices used to interact with a 3-D space are also examined. Issues in 3-D network visualisation are elicited from  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> three viewpoints: psychological, task-related and  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> implementational. Consideration of these issues  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> leads to the design of a preliminary experimental  </abstract>::line_number::13

<title>  Networks and the Best Approximation Property   </title>::line_number::7
<author>  Federico Girosi and Tomaso Poggio   </author>::line_number::8
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Networks can be considered as approximation schemes. Multilayer networks of the  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> backpropagation type can approximate arbitrarily well continuous functions (Cybenko,  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> 1989; Funahashi, 1989; Stinchcombe and White, 1989). We prove that networks derived from regularization theory and including Radial Basis Functions (Poggio and  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> Girosi, 1989), have a similar property. From the point of view of approximation theory, however, the property of approximating continuous functions arbitrarily well is not  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> sufficient for characterizing good approximation schemes. More critical is the property  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> of best approximation. The main result of this paper is that multilayer networks, of the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> type used in backpropagation, are not best approximation. For regularization networks  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> (in particular Radial Basis Function networks) we prove existence and uniqueness of  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> best approximation.   </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Programmers using imperative languages have a number of well-established debugging tools available to them; functional programmers have few, if any, tools available.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Many of the tools and techniques developed for debugging functional programs are  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> based on those for imperative programming and lack a theoretical basis relevant to  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> functional programming. In addition, the techniques used are typically very time-consuming. A theoretical foundation on which to base the study of errors and debugging in functional programming is presented in this report. Using this theoretical  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> foundation, a set of program transformation schemes has been developed which facilitate the location of the type of error which results in an evaluation-time error message  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> and the termination of evaluation. A brief description of the practical experience ob  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract>  ABSTRACT  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> Communication in real-time systems has to be predictable, because unpredictable delays in  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> the delivery of messages can adversely affect the execution of tasks dependent on these messages.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> In this paper, we develop a scheme for providing predictable inter-process communication in  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> real-time systems with (partially connected) point-to-point interconnection networks, which  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> provides guarantees on the maximum delivery time for messages. This scheme is based on the  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> concept of a real-time channel, a unidirectional connection between source and destination. A  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> real-time channel has parameters which describe the performance requirements of the source-destination communication, e.g., from a sensor station to a control site. Once such a channel  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> is established, the communications subsystem guarantees that these performance requirements  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> will be met. In this paper, we concentrate on methods to compute guarantees for the delivery time of messages belonging to real-time channels. We also address problems associated  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> with allocating buffers for these messages and develop a scheme which preserves delivery time  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> guarantees.   </abstract>::line_number::23

<author>  Alain Sei and William Symes    </author>::line_number::2
<note>  (Submitted to the Journal of Scientific Computing)   </note>::line_number::3
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> We present in this paper a comparison of the dispersion properties for several finite-difference approximations of the acoustic wave equation. We investigate the compact and  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> staggered schemes of fourth order accuracy in space and of second order or fourth order accuracy in time. We derive the computational cost of the simulation implied by a precision  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> criterion on the numerical simulation (maximum allowed error in phase or group velocity).  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> We conclude that for moderate accuracy the staggered scheme of second order in time is more  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> efficient, whereas for very precise simulation the compact scheme of fourth order in time is  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> a better choice. The comparison increasingly favors the lower order staggered scheme as the  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> dimension increases. In three dimensional simulation, the cost of extremely precise simulation with any of the schemes is very large, whereas for simulation of moderate precision the  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> staggered scheme is the least expensive.   </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> We analyze a space-time domain decomposition iteration, for a model advection  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> diffusion equation in one and two dimensions. The asymptotic convergence rate is  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> superlinear, and it is governed by the diffusion of the error across the overlap between  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> subdomains. Hence, it depends on both the size of this overlap and the diffusion  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> coefficient in the equation. However, it is independent of the number of subdomains.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> The convergence rate for the heat equation in a large time window is initially linear and  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> it deteriorates as the number of subdomains increases. The duration of the transient  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> linear regime is proportional to the length of the time window. For advection dominated  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> problems, the convergence rate is initially linear and it improves as the the ratio of  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> advection to diffusion increases. Moreover, it is independent of the size of the time  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> window and of the number of subdomains. In two space dimensions, the iteration  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> possesses the smoothing property: high modes of the error are damped much faster  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> then low modes. This is a result of the natural smoothing property of the heat equation.  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> Numerical calculations illustrate our analysis.   </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract>  ABSTRACT  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> This paper discusses a method for training multilayer  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> perceptron networks called DMP2 (Dynamic Multilayer  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Perceptron 2). The method is based upon a divide and conquer  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> approach which builds networks in the form of binary trees,  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> dynamically allocating nodes and layers as needed. The focus  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> of this paper is on the effects of using multiple node types  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> within the DMP framework. Simulation results show that  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> DMP2 performs favorably in comparison with other learning  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> algorithms, and that using multiple node types can be  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> beneficial to network performance.   </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract. This paper presents an inductive learning system called the Genetic Instance-Based  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Learning (GIBL) system. This system combines instance-based learning approaches with  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> evolutionary computation in order to achieve high accuracy in the presence of irrelevant or  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> redundant attributes. Evolutionary computation is used to find a set of attribute weights that  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> yields a high estimate of classification accuracy. Results of experiments on 16 data sets are  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> shown, and are compared with a non-weighted version of the instance-based learning system.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> The results indicate that the generalization accuracy of GIBL is somewhat higher than that of the  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> non-weighted system on regular data, and is significantly higher on data with irrelevant or  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> redundant attributes.   </abstract>::line_number::15

<title>  Incremental Cryptography and Application to Virus Protection   </title>::line_number::0
<author>  Mihir Bellare Oded Goldreich Shafi Goldwasser    </author>::line_number::1
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::2
<abstract> The goal of incremental cryptography is to design cryptographic algorithms with the property that having applied  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> the algorithm to a document, it is possible to quickly update  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> the result of the algorithm for a modified document, rather  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> than having to re-compute it from scratch. In settings where  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> cryptographic algorithms such as encryption or signatures  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> are frequently applied to changing documents, dramatic efficiency improvements can be achieved. One such setting is  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> the use of authentication tags for virus protection.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> We consider documents that can be modified by powerful (and realistic) document modification operations such as  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> insertion and deletion of character-strings (or equivalently  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> cut and paste of text). We provide efficient incremental  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> signature and message authentication schemes supporting  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> the above document modification operations. They meet a  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> strong notion of tamper-proof security which is appropriate  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> for the virus protection setting. We initiate a study of incremental encryption, providing definitions as well as solutions.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> Finally, we raise the novel issue of "privacy" of incremental  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> authentication schemes.   </abstract>::line_number::18

<title>  On Yao's XOR-Lemma   </title>::line_number::0

<date>  March 1995 (corrected Dec. 1995 and March 1998)   </date>::line_number::2
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> A fundamental Lemma of Yao states that computational weak-unpredictability  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> of functions gets amplified if the results of several independent instances are XOR  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> together. We survey two known proofs of Yao's Lemma and present a third alternative proof. The third proof proceeds by first proving that a function constructed  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> by concatenating the values of the function on several independent instances is much  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> more unpredictable, with respect to specified complexity bounds, than the original  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> function. This statement turns out to be easier to prove than the XOR-Lemma.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Using a result of Goldreich and Levin and some elementary observation, we derive  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the XOR-Lemma.   </abstract>::line_number::11

<title>  Eventually-Serializable Data Services   </title>::line_number::0
<author>  Alan Fekete David Gupta Victor Luchangco Nancy Lynch Alex Shvartsman    </author>::line_number::1
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::2
<abstract> We present a new specification for distributed data services that trade-off immediate consistency guarantees  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> for improved system availability and efficiency, while  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> ensuring the long-term consistency of the data. An  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> eventually-serializable data service maintains the operations requested in a partial order that gravitates over  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> time towards a total order. It provides clear and unambiguous guarantees about the immediate and long-term  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> behavior of the system. To demonstrate its utility, we  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> present an algorithm, based on one of Ladin, Liskov,  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Shrira, and Ghemawat [12], that implements this specification. Our algorithm provides the interface of the  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> abstract service, and generalizes their algorithm by allowing general operations and greater flexibility in specifying consistency requirements. We also describe how  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> to use this specification as a building block for applications such as directory services.   </abstract>::line_number::12

<title>  Incoercible Multiparty Computation   </title>::line_number::0
<note>  (Extended Abstract)    </note>::line_number::1
<author>  Ran Canetti Rosario Gennaro    </author>::line_number::2
<date>  May 17, 1996   </date>::line_number::3
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> Current secure multiparty protocols have the following deficiency. The public transcript of the communication can be used as an involuntary commitment of the parties to their inputs and outputs. Thus  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> parties can be later coerced by some authority to reveal their private data. Previous work that has  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> pointed this interesting problem out contained only partial treatment.  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> In this work we present the first general and rigorous treatment of the coercion problem in secure computation. First we present a general definition of protocols that provide resilience to coercion. Our  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> definition constitutes a natural extension of the general paradigm used for defining secure multiparty  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> protocols. Next we show that if trapdoor permutations exist then any function can be incoercibly  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> computed (i.e., computed by a protocol that provides resilience to coercion) in the presence of com-putationally bounded adversaries and only public communication channels. This holds as long as less  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> than half the parties are coerced (or corrupted). In particular, ours are the first incoercible protocols  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> without physical assumptions. Also, our protocols constitute an alternative solution to the recently  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> solved adaptive security problem.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> Our techniques are quite surprising and include non-standard use of deniable encryptions.   </abstract>::line_number::15

<title>  Proactive RSA   </title>::line_number::0
<author>  Yair Frankel Peter Gemmell Philip D. MacKenzie Moti Yung x   </author>::line_number::1
<date>  August 4, 1996   </date>::line_number::2
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> The notion of "proactive security" of basic primitives and cryptosystems that are distributed  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> amongst various servers, was introduced in order to tolerate a very strong "mobile adversary." This  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> adversary may corrupt all participants throughout the lifetime of the system in a non-monotonic  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> fashion (i.e. recoveries are possible) but the adversary is unable to corrupt too many participants  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> during any short time period [OstrovskyYung]. The notion assures increased security and availability  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> of the cryptographic primitive.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> We present a proactive RSA system in which a threshold of servers applies the RSA signature  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> (or decryption) function in a distributed manner; RSA is perhaps the most important trapdoor  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> function in use. Employing new combinatorial and elementary number theoretic techniques, our  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> protocol enables the dynamic updating of the servers (which hold the RSA key distributively);  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> it is secure even when a linear number of the servers are corrupted during any time period (linear  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> redundancy); it efficiently "self-maintains" the security of the function and its messages (ciphertexts  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> or signatures); and it enables continuous availability, namely, correct function application using the  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> shared key is possible at any time.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> We present an efficient way in which l servers can share an RSA private function so that, given  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> 0 &lt; &lt; t &lt; 1:  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> * Proactive (Dynamic) Robustness: A gateway G can combine information from any set of lt  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> (honest) servers to deduce the RSA signature for any authorized message at any period.  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> * Proactive Security (against mobile adversary): Our protocol is secure against a polynomial  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> time adversary who controls the gateway G and time-variant sets of up to minfl(1 t ); lg  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> servers, and can obtain the shares of up to l servers (including those that it corrupts).  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> * Uniform Boundedness: The share-size is always bounded by the size of an RSA private key  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> (i.e., logarithmically in N ).  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> We also present special practical instances based on designs; some of these instances were recently  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> implemented as part of a highly secure application testbed at Sandia National Laboratories.  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> A major technical difficulty in "proactivizing" RSA was the fact that the servers have to update  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> the "distributed representation" of an RSA key, while not learning the order of the group from  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> which keys are drawn (in order not to compromise the RSA security).   </abstract>::line_number::31

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> A unified, comprehensive presentation of simulation techniques for verification of concurrent systems is given, in terms of a simple untimed automaton model. In particular,  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> (1) refinements, (2) forward and backward simulations, (3) hybrid forward-backward  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> and backward-forward simulations, and (4) history and prophecy relations are defined.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> History and prophecy relations are abstract versions of the history and prophecy variables of Abadi and Lamport, as well as the auxiliary variables of Owicki and Gries.  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> Relationships between the different types of simulations, as well as soundness and  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> completeness results, are stated and proved. Finally, it is shown how invariants can be  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> incorporated into all the simulations.  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> Even though many results are presented here for the first time, this paper can  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> also be read as a survey (in a simple setting) of the research literature on simulation  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> techniques.  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> The development for untimed automata is designed to support a similar development for timed automata. In Part II of this paper, it is shown how the results of this  </abstract>::line_number::27

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Previous efforts at facial expression recognition have  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> been based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> representation developed in order to allow human psychologists to code expression from static facial mugshots. In  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> this paper we develop new, more accurate representations  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> for facial expression by building a video database of facial  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> expressions and then probabilistically characterizing the  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> facial muscle activation associated with each expression  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> using a detailed physical model of the skin and muscles.  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> This produces a muscle-based representation of facial motion, which is then used to recognize facial expressions in  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> two different ways. The first method uses the physics-based  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> model directly, by recognizing expressions through comparison of estimated muscle activations. The second method  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> uses the physics-based model to generate spatio-temporal  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> motion-energy templates of the whole face for each different  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> expression. These simple, biologically-plausible motion  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> energy templates are then used for recognition. Both  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> methods show substantially greater accuracy at expression  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> recognition than has been previously achieved.   </abstract>::line_number::24

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> A thesaurus is a book containing synonyms in a  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> given language; it provides similarity links when  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> trying to retrieve articles or stories about a particular topic. A "visual thesaurus" works with  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> pictures, not words. It aids in recognizing visually similar events, "visual synonyms," including  </abstract>::line_number::10

<abstract> recent research results in the MIT Media Lab  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> which contribute toward this goal. The heart  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> of the method is a learning system which gathers information by interacting with a user of a  </abstract>::line_number::15

<title>  Building Query Optimizers with Combinators:   </title>::line_number::0
<note>  Dissertation Proposal   </note>::line_number::1
<author>  Mitch Cherniack   </author>::line_number::2
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> Query optimizers generate plans to retrieve data specified by queries. Query optimization  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> for object databases (i.e., object-oriented and object-relational databases) is an immature field,  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> and stands to benefit from adaptation of techniques that have proved useful for relations. One  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> technique uses query-to-query transformations to rewrite queries into queries that are potentially  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> more amenable to plan generation. For transformations to be useful, they must preserve the  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> semantics of the queries they rewrite (correctness) and usually result in queries that generate  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> better plans (effectiveness). Object databases complicate the expression of correct and effective  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> transformations.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Transformation correctness is problematic even for relational queries. Especially error-prone  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> are transformations that rewrite complex nested queries (queries containing other queries) or  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> queries that return duplicates. Objects make correctness more difficult because object queries  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> can be far more complex than relational queries.  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> The effectiveness of a relational transformation typically depends on the syntax of a query  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> rather than the semantics of of its data or functions. On the other hand, the lack of uniformity  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> in data functions and collections in an object query makes effectiveness more subtle. The effectiveness of a transformation for object queries may depend on the semantics of data functions,  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> and may vary from object to object in a collection. Therefore, optimizers may have to perform  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> sophisticated reasoning and apply transformations on a per object basis to ensure that they are  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> used only when appropriate.  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> This thesis considers the correctness and effectiveness of optimizer transformations. To  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> address correctness, we propose a formally specified query algebra and two-tiered language  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> (COKO-KOLA) for expressing transformations that can be verified with a theorem prover. To  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> address effectiveness, we propose semantic and dynamic extensions to the traditional optimizer  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> architecture. The high-level contribution of the thesis is the observation that the choice of  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> query representation impacts the quality of the optimizer. Specifically, a combinator-based  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> (variable-free) query representation simplifies the query manipulations that are required to make  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> transformations correct and effective.   </abstract>::line_number::29

<abstract>  ABSTRACT  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Simplicial depth is a way to measure how deep a point is among a set of points. Efficient  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> algorithms to compute it are important to the usefulness of its applications, such as in  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> multivariate analysis in statistics. A straightforward method takes O(n d+1 ) time when the  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> points are in d-dimensional space. We discuss an algorithm that takes O(n 2 ) time when the  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> points are in three-dimensional space, and we generalize it to four-dimensional space with  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> a time complexity of O(n 4 ). For spaces higher than four-dimensional, there are no known  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> algorithms faster than the straightforward method.   </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> This paper presents an efficient algorithm for constructing Bayesian belief networks from databases. The  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> algorithm takes a database and an attributes ordering (i.e., the causal attributes of an attribute should appear earlier  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> in the order) as input and constructs a belief network structure as output. The construction process is based on the  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> computation of mutual information of attribute pairs. Given a data set which is large enough and has a DAG-Isomorphic probability distribution, this algorithm guarantees that the perfect map [1] of the underlying dependency  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> model is generated, and at the same time, enjoys the time complexity of O N( ) 2 on conditional independence (CI)  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> tests. To evaluate this algorithm, we present the experimental results on three versions of the well-known ALARM  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> network database, which has 37 attributes and 10,000 records. The correctness proof and the analysis of  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> computational complexity are also presented. We also discuss the features of our work and relate it to previous  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> works.   </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> A novel algorithm, named SeqMapII, of technology  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> mapping with retiming for optimal clock period for K-LUT based FPGAs was recently proposed by Pan and  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Liu [13]. The time complexity of their algorithm, however, is O(K 3 n 4 log(Kn 2 ) log n) for sequential circuits  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> with n gates, which is too high for medium and large  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> size designs in practice. In this paper, we present  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> three strategies to improve the performance of the approach in [13]: 1) efficient label update with single  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> K-cut computation based on the monotone property  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> of labels that we showed for sequential circuits, 2) a  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> novel approach for the K-cut computation on partial  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> flow networks, which are much smaller in practice, 3)  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> SCC (strongly connected component) partition to further speedup the algorithm. In practice, our algorithm  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> works in O(K 2 n 3 log n) time and O(Kn) space according to our experimental results. It is 2fi10 4 times faster  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> than SeqMapII-opt for computing optimal solutions and  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> 2 times faster than SeqMapII-heu which uses very small  </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> An extended visual cryptography scheme, EVCS for short, for an access structure  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> ( Qual ; Forb ) on a set of n participants, is a technique to encode n images in such a  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> way that when we stack together the transparencies associated to participants in any  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> set X 2 Qual we get the secret message with no trace of the original images, but any  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> X 2 Forb has no information on the shared image. Moreover, after the original images  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> are encoded they are still meaningful, that is, any user will recognize the image on his  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> transparency.  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> The main contributions of this paper are the following:  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> * A trade-off between the contrast of the reconstructed image and the contrast of the  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> image on each transparency for (k; k)-threshold EVCS (in a (k; k)-threshold EVCS  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> the image is visible if and only if k transparencies are stacked together). This yields  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of (k; k)-threshold EVCS for  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> the values of such contrasts. In case a scheme exists we explicitly construct it.  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> * A general technique to implement extended visual cryptography schemes, which  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> uses hypergraph colourings. This technique yields (k; k)-threshold EVCS which  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> are optimal with respect to the pixel expansion. Finally, we discuss some applications of this technique to various interesting classes of access structures by using  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> relevant results from the theory of hypergraph colourings.   </abstract>::line_number::30

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> This paper describes automatic document categorization based on large text hierarchy. We  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> handle the large number of features and training examples by taking into account hierarchical  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> structure of examples and using feature selection for large text data. We experimentally evaluate  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> feature subset selection on real-world text data collected from the existing Web hierarchy named  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> Yahoo. In our learning experiments naive Bayesian classifier was used on text data using feature-vector document representation that includes word sequences (n-grams) instead of just single words  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> (unigrams). Experimental evaluation on real-world data collected form the Web shows that our  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> approach gives promising results and can potentially be used for document categorization on the  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> Web. Additionally the best result on our data is achieved for relatively small feature subset, while for  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> larger subset the performance substantially drops. The best performance among six tested feature  </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract> Access to shared data is provided today by distributed file systems and  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> databases. In this paper, we explore certain usage and technological trends that  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> will radically change the way shared data is used in the future. The usage trends  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> include the growing need to access shared data from anywhere, increasing scale,  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> and the increasing importance of efficient search. The technology trends include  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> the advent of portable machines, the availability of software and hardware for  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> using diverse types of data, and the growing diversity of network speeds and  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> capabilities. These trends induce fundamental research problems in the areas of  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract> In this paper we show that application-aware adaptation, a  </abstract>::line_number::6

<abstract> to mobile information access. We describe the design of  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Odyssey, a prototype implementing this approach, and show  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> how it supports concurrent execution of diverse mobile applications. We identify agility as a key attribute of adaptive systems, and describe how to quantify and measure it.  </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract>  ABSTRACT  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> We present recent advances from our efforts in increasing coverage, robustness, generality and speed of JANUS, CMU's  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> speech-to-speech translation system. JANUS is a speaker-independent system which translates spoken utterances in  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> English and also in German into one of German, English or  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Japanese. The system has been designed around the task  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> of conference registration (CR). It has initially been built  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> based on a speech database of 12 read dialogs, encompassing a vocabulary of around 500 words. We have since been  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> expanding the system along several dimensions to improve  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> speed, robustness and coverage and to move toward spontaneous input.   </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> AURORA is a vision-based system designed to warn a vehicle driver of possible impending roadway departure accidents. It employs a downward looking color video camera with a wide angle  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> lens, a digitizer, and a portable Sun Sparc workstation. Using a binormalized adjustable template  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> correlation algorithm, it reliably detects lane markers on structured roads at 60 Hz. A time-to-lane-crossing (TLC) measurement is calculated for each image based on the estimation of vehicles lateral position and velocity. This measurement is used to trigger an alarm when the TLC falls below  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> a preset threshold. Promising results have been achieved under a variety of weather and lighting  </abstract>::line_number::9

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> Binary manipulators are powered by actuators  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> which have only two stable states. Therefore, they  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> can reach only a discrete (but possibly large) number  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> of locations. Compared to a manipulator built with  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> continuous actuators, a binary manipulator provides  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> reasonable performance, and is relatively inexpensive  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> (up to an order of magnitude cheaper). The number  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> of states of a binary manipulator grows exponentially  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> with the number of actuators. This makes the calculation of its inverse kinematics quite difficult. This  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> paper presents a combinatorial method for computing  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> the inverse kinematics of a binary manipulator that  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> reduces the search space to a manageable size. It also  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> creates extremely smooth motions that follow a specified trajectory very accurately (in both position and  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> orientation), despite the discrete nature of binary actuation.   </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract. This paper presents an overview of a parallelizing compiler  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> to automatically generate efficient code for large-scale parallel architectures from sequential input programs. This research focuses on loop-level  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> parallelism in dense matrix computations. We illustrate the basic techniques the compiler uses by describing the entire compilation process for  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> a simple example.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Our compiler is organized into three major phases: analyzing array references, allocating the computation and data to the processors to optimize  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> parallelism and locality, and generating code.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> An optimizing compiler for scalable parallel machines requires more sophisticated program analysis than the traditional data dependence analysis. Our compiler uses a precise data-flow analysis technique to identify  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> the producer of the value read by each instance of a read access. In order to allocate the computation and data to the processors, the compiler  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> first transforms the program to expose loop-level parallelism in the computation. It then finds a decomposition of the computation and data  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> such that parallelism is exploited and the communication overhead is  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> minimized. The compiler will trade off extra degrees of parallelism to  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> reduce or eliminate communication. Finally, the compiler generates code  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> to manage the multiple address spaces and to communicate data across  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> processors.   </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> The communication latency is a major issue that must be dealt with in parallel  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> computing. The parallel computation model therefore must provide the ability to tolerate  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> such latencies. Communication using blocking receives is the commonly used mechanism  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> in parallel programming today. Message driven execution is an alternate mechanism  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> which does not use receive style statements at all. The message driven execution style  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> promotes the overlap of computation and communication: Programs written in this style  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> exhibit increased latency tolerance. However, they are often difficult to develop and  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> debug. We present a coordination language called Dagger to alleviate this problem. The  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> language has a mechanism which is called expect, that replaces the receive statement.  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> It has been implemented in the Charm parallel programming system, and runs programs  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> portably on a variety of parallel machines.   </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract One of the main hurdles to improved CLIR effectiveness is resolving ambiguity associated with translation.  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> Availability of resources is also a problem. First we present a  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> technique based on co-occurrence statistics from unlinked corpora which can be used to reduce the ambiguity associated with  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> phrasal and term translation. We then combine this method  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> with other techniques for reducing ambiguity and achieve more  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> than 90% monolingual effectiveness. Finally, we compare the  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> co-occurrence method with parallel corpus and machine translation techniques and show that good retrieval effectiveness can  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> be achieved without complex resources.   </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract> The retrieval of images based on their visual similarity  </abstract>::line_number::6

<abstract> Two images may be said to be similar if they have similar distributions of such features. Global similarity may,  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> Since uncalibrated images permit only projective reconstruction, metric information requires either  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> camera or scene calibration. We propose a stratified approach to projective reconstruction, in which  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> gradual increase in domain information for scene calibration leads to gradual increase in 3D information.  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> Our scheme includes the following steps: (1) Register the images with respect to a reference plane; this  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> can be done using limited scene information, e.g., the knowledge that two pairs of lines on the plane are  </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract>  Abstract: Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general,  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> constructs a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization,  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> analysts often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> rate over completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> performance task we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> simplicity dimensions.   </abstract>::line_number::27

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> We empirically analyze and compare two simple, deterministic policies for scheduling dynamically evolving tree-structured computations on parallel architectures that are rings of identical  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> processing elements (PEs). Our computations have each task either halt or spawn two independent children; they abstract, for instance, computations generated by multigrid methods. Our  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> simpler policy, called koso, has each PE keep one child of a spawning task and pass the other  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> to its clockwise neighbor in the ring; our more sophisticated policy, called koso ? , operates similarly, but allows child-passing only from a more heavily loaded PE to a more lightly loaded one.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Both policies execute waiting tasks in increasing order of their depths in the evolving task-tree.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> Based on partial (mathematical) analyses of our policies' behaviors, we conjectured that both  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> yield good parallel speedup on large classes of the computations we study, but that policy  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> koso ? outperforms policy koso in many important situations. Not having been able to verify  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> these conjectures analytically, we study them in this paper via a suite of carefully designed and  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> analyzed experiments. Our experiments largely substantiate both of our conjectures. We find  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> that both policies give close to optimal parallel speedup on large classes of computations, and  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> that koso ? outperforms koso on these computations, except on very small processor rings.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> We believe that our methodology of experimental design and analysis will prove useful in other  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> such studies.   </abstract>::line_number::21

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> Today's high-performance RISC microprocessors have been  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> highly tuned for integer and floating point application performance. These architectures have paid less attention to  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> operating system requirements. At the same time, new operating system designs often have overlooked modern architectural trends which may unavoidably change the relative  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> cost of certain primitive operations. The result is that operating system performance is well below application code  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> performance on contemporary RISCs.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> This paper examines recent directions in computer architecture and operating systems, and the implications of  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> changes in each domain for the other. The requirements of  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> three components of operating system design are discussed  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> in detail: interprocess communication, virtual memory, and  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> thread management. For each component, we relate operating system functional and performance needs to the mechanisms available on commercial RISC architectures such as  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> the MIPS R2000 and R3000, Sun SPARC, IBM RS6000,  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> Motorola 88000, and Intel i860.  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> Our analysis reveals a number of specific reasons why  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> the performance of operating system primitives on RISCs  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> has not scaled with integer performance. In addition,  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> we identify areas in which architectures could better (and  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> cost-effectively) accommodate operating system needs, and  </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract>  ABSTRACT  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> Many important and useful applications for software agents  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> require multiple agents on a network that communicate with  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> each other. Such agents must find each other and perform a  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> useful joint computation without having to know about every  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> other such agent on the network. This paper describes a  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> matchmaker  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> system, designed to find people with similar interests and introduce them to each other. The matchmaker is  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> designed to introduce   </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> everyone  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> , unlike conventional Internet  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> media which only allow those who take the time to   </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> speak  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> public to be known.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> The paper details how the agents that make it up the match-making system can function in a decentralized fashion, yet  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> can group themselves into clusters which reflect their users  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> interests; these clusters are then used to make introductions or  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> allow users to send messages to others who share their inter  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> ests. The algorithm uses   </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> referrals  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> from one agent to another  </abstract>::line_number::26

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> We describe the design and implementation of a compiler  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> that automatically translates ordinary programs written in  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> a subset of ML into code that generates native code at run  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> time. Run-time code generation can make use of values and  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> invariants that cannot be exploited at compile time, yielding  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> code that is often superior to statically optimal code. But  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> the cost of optimizing and generating code at run time can  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> be prohibitive. We demonstrate how compile-time specialization can reduce the cost of run-time code generation by  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> an order of magnitude without greatly affecting code quality.  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> Several benchmark programs are examined, which exhibit an  </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> This paper provides a tutorial introduction to visual servo control of robotic manipulators.  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> Since the topic spans many disciplines our goal is limited to providing a basic conceptual framework. We begin by reviewing the prerequisite topics from robotics and computer vision, including  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> a brief review of coordinate transformations, velocity representation, and a description of the  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> geometric aspects of the image formation process. We then present a taxonomy of visual servo  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> control systems. The two major classes of systems, position-based and image-based systems, are  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> then discussed. Since any visual servo system must be capable of tracking image features in a  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> sequence of images, we include an overview of feature-based and correlation-based methods for  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> tracking. We conclude the tutorial with a number of observations on the current directions of  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> the research field of visual servo control.   </abstract>::line_number::29

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> We have implemented a parallel version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm for the single-source shortest paths  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> problem. Our software has been developed on the CM-5 using C with CMMD communication primitives.  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> We have empirically compared the efficiency of our implementation with a sequential implementation of  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm developed by Cherkassky, Goldberg and Radzik. We have performed  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> our experiments using fifty randomly generated graphs with vertex counts in the range between 2 10 and  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> 2 15 and edge counts in the range between 2 11 and 2 21 . In our experiments, the parallel implementation  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> becomes faster than the sequential implementation when the average degree of the input graphs exceeds  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> 2 5 or 2 6 . For the dense graphs in our test suite, we obtain speedups of up to 3.3 on 32 processors and up  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> to 8.3 on 128 processors.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> In the implementation we discuss in this paper, several design decisions were taken in view of the limited  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> time we had to complete a working version of our software. For example, instead of performing any kind  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> of dynamic load balancing, we try to keep the computation load balanced by applying a straightforward  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> data distribution scheme at the beginning of the computation. Moreover, in the code that runs on  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> each processor, we avoid any sophisticated data structures and only use linear arrays. We are currently  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> experimenting with alternative implementations that may lead to improved speedups, particularly on the  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> denser graphs of our test suite.   </abstract>::line_number::24

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> The paper presents the general theory of designing multidimensional Quadrature Mirror Filters (QMF),  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> for use in sub-band coding (SBC) systems, using the McClellan transform [1]. It was recently shown that  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> McClellan transform could be used to generate 2-D diamond shape QMF filters [2]. In this paper we will  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> formalize the proofs of the diamond shape case, and generalize it to other shapes, sampling rasters and  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> dimensions.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Moreover we show that we do not really need the 1-D QMF filters: it is also possible and even more  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> convenient to design QMF filter banks by performing transformations on a class of real valued polynomials.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> Examples are given of two dimensional diamond and fan-shape filters and three dimensional tetrad filters  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> designed using this transformation technique.   </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract> A recognition strategy consisting of a mixture of indexing on invariants and search, allows objects to be recog-nised up to a Euclidean ambiguity with an uncalibrated  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> camera. The approach works by using projective invariants to determine all the possible projectively equivalent  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> models for a particular imaged object; then a system of  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> global consistency constraints is used to determine which of  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> these projectively equivalent, but Euclidean distinct, models corresponds to the objects viewed. These constraints  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> follow from properties of the imaging geometry. In particular, a recognition hypothesis is equivalent to an assertion about, among other things, viewing conditions and geometric relationships between objects, and these assertions  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract> This paper describes several key trends in technology that will inuence the design of file systems for the next decade. It first outlines the basic trends to hardware performance that underlie  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> file system design. These trends affect both user demands on file systems and trade-offs in their  </abstract>::line_number::8

<abstract> technology trends impact specific aspects of the xFS file systems serverless design [Dahlin  </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> We advocate the use of Common Lisp as a powerful glue for  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> building scientific computing environments. Naturally one  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> then has to address mixing pre-existing (non Lisp) code into  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> this system. We provide a specific example as an elaborate  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> FORTRAN system written by David Bailey for arbitrary-precision floating-point numeric calculation. We discuss the  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> advantages and disadvantages of wholesale importing into  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> Lisp. A major advantage is being able to use state-of-the  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> art packaged software sooner, while overcoming the disadvantages caused by FORTRAN's traditional batch orientation and weak storage model. In this paper we emphasize in  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> particular how effective use of imported systems may require  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> one to address the contrast between the functional (Lisp-like) versus state-transition-based (Fortran-like) approaches  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> to dealing with compound objects. While our example is  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> high-precision floats, other highly useful packages including those for simulation, PDE solutions, signal processing,  </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> In this paper, we study the tradeoffs involved in choosing the bit allocation in a  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> multiresolution remote image retrieval system. Such a system uses a multiresolution  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> image coding scheme so that a user accessing the database will first see a coarse  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> version of the images and will be able to accept or discard a given image faster,  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> without needing to receive all the image data. We formalize the problem of choosing  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> the bit allocation (e.g., in the two resolution case, how many bits should be given  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> to the coarse image and the additional information, respectively?) so that the  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> overall delay in the query is minimized. We provide analytical methods to find the  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> optimal solution under different configurations and show how a good choice of the  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> bit allocation results in a significant reduction of the overall delay in the query (by  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> up to a factor of two in some cases).   </abstract>::line_number::26

<abstract> hosts violate many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded performance. In this paper, we describe a  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> simple protocol that improves TCP performance by modifying network-layer software only at a basestation without  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> violating end-to-end TCP semantics. The main idea is to  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> cache packets at the basestation and perform local  </abstract>::line_number::6

<abstract> is significantly more robust in the presence of multiple  </abstract>::line_number::8

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Several researchers have proposed algorithms for basic block reordering. We call these branch alignment algorithms. The primary  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> emphasis of these algorithms has been on improving instruction  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> cache locality, and the few studies concerned with branch prediction reported small or minimal improvements. As wide-issue architectures become increasingly popular the importance of reducing  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> branch costs will increase, and branch alignment is one mechanism  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> which can effectively reduce these costs.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> In this paper, we propose an improved branch alignment algorithm that takes into consideration the architectural cost model and  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> the branch prediction architecture when performing the basic block  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> reordering. We show that branch alignment algorithms can improve  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> a broad range of static and dynamic branch prediction architectures.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> We also show that a programs performance can be improved by approximately 5% even when using recently proposed, highly accurate  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> branch prediction architectures. The programs are compiled by any  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> existing compiler and then transformed via binary transformations.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> When implementing these algorithms on a Alpha AXP 21604 up to  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> a 16% reduction in total execution time is achieved.   </abstract>::line_number::21

<abstract>  Abstract: This paper presents empirical data on the behavior of large dataflow programs on  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> a distributed memory multiprocessor. The programs, written in the dataflow language Id90, are  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> compiled via a Threaded Abstract Machine (TAM) for the CM-5. TAM refines dataflow execution  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> models by addressing critical constraints that modern parallel architectures place on the compilation  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> of general-purpose parallel programming languages. It exposes synchronization, scheduling, and  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> network access so that the compiler can optimize against the cost of these operations.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> The data presented in this paper evaluates the TAM approach in compiling dataflow languages  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> on stock hardware. We present data on the instruction mix, speedup, scheduling behavior, and  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> locality of large ID90 programs. It is shown that the TAM scheduling hierarchy is able to tolerate  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> long communication latencies, especially when some degree of I-structure locality is present. We investigate how frame allocation strategies, k-bounded loops, and I-structure caching and distribution  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> together affect the overall efficiency. Finally we document some scheduling anomalies.   </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> As the difference in speed between processor and memory system continues to increase, it is becoming crucial to develop  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> and refine techniques that enhance the effectiveness of cache  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> hierarchies. Two such techniques are data prefetching and  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> data forwarding. With prefetching, a processor hides the latency of cache misses by requesting the data before it actually  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> needs it. With forwarding, a producer processor hides the  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> latency of communication-induced cache misses in the consumer processors by sending the data to the caches of the  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> latter. These two techniques are complementary approaches  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> to hiding the latency of communication-induced misses.  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> This paper compares the effectiveness of data forwarding  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> and data prefetching to hide communication-induced misses.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> Although both techniques require comparable hardware support, forwarding usually has a lower instruction overhead. We  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> evaluate prefetching and forwarding algorithms in a paralleliz-ing compiler using execution-driven simulations of a shared-memory multiprocessor. Both data forwarding and prefetch-ing reduce the execution time of applications significantly (30-40% on average). Forwarding performs better on average,  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> while prefetching is more robust to changes in cache and memory parameters. Finally, we propose two ways of integrating  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> the two techniques. The integration of the two techniques reduces the execution time even more (43-48% on average) and  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> is very robust.   </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> Optimizing on-chip primary data caches for parallel scientific applications is challenging because different applications  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> exhibit different behavior. Indeed, while some applications  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> exhibit good spatial locality, others have accesses with long  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> strides that prevent the effective use of cache lines. Finally,  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> other applications cannot exploit long lines because they exhibit false sharing. To help processors execute these three  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> types of applications efficiently, we introduce the Pool Buffer,  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> a small direct-mapped cache accessed in parallel with the primary cache. The function of the pool buffer is to fetch long  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> sectors of relatively short cache lines from memory on a miss,  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> while only letting into the cache the lines that the processor  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> actually references. The pool buffer can also perform sequential prefetching of sectors.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> An evaluation of the pool buffer based on simulations of  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> five 32-processor Perfect Club codes yields encouraging results. Adding a pool buffer of one-quarter the size of the  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> cache causes a small increase in area while usually achieving  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> large reductions in execution time. For example, for a range  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> of caches with 32-byte lines, the execution time decreases by  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> an average of about 20%. We also show that small 1-Kbyte  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> buffers are often large enough to get most of the potential  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> benefits. Finally, caches with pool buffers are more effective  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> than caches with long lines and no pool buffer.   </abstract>::line_number::25

<abstract> Kinetic simulation of plasmas in which equilibrium occurs over ion timescales poses  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> a computational challenge due to the disparate timescales of the electron plasma frequency (~ 10 9 ), the ion plasma frequency (~ 10 7 ), ion transit frequency (~ 10 6 ), and  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> the ionization frequency (~ 10 7 ). Hybrid electrostatic PIC algorithms are presented  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> in which the electrons reach thermodynamic equilibrium with the ions each time step.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> There are two different approximations for the electrons. First, the nonlinear Boltzmann relationship for the electrons can be applied to the bulk of a plasma. Second,  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> there is a truncated Maxwellian which is used in sheaths; this approximation truncates  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract> These approximations neglect effects faster than ion time-scales, decreasing the computer time used by over an order of magnitude; however, they increase the complexity  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> Experiments have shown[1],[2] that ion acoustic solitons tunnel through the space charge sheath  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> in front of a grid without time delay. They are absorbed resonantly when the spatial width of the  </abstract>::line_number::7

<abstract> coefficients found in these experiments have compared well with theory in the long wavelength limit[3].  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> However, to achieve this comparison, two parameters were added that were not in the original theory.  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> These parameters allow for the absorption of wave energy by the space charge sheath. The goal of our  </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> This survey paper describes the current approaches on the update-in-place analysis  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> for sets. Pure functional languages do not allow mutations, destructive updates, or selective updates so that straightforward implementations of functional language compilers  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> may induce large amounts of copying to preserve program semantics. The unnecessary  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> copying of data can increase both the execution time and the memory requirements of  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> an application. Introducing sets to functional languages as a primitive data constructor posts a new problem of update-in-place analysis in functional languages. Moreover, most of the compiler optimization techniques depend on the side-effects and the  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> update-in-place analysis serves as the premise of applying such optimization techniques.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> Among other compiler optimization techniques, finite differencing captures common yet  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> distinctive program constructions of costly repeated calculations and transforms them  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> into more efficient incremental program constructions. This dissertation is an attempt  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> to explore the update-in-place analysis for sets in functional languages in order to apply finite differencing to compiling pure functional languages. In this survey paper,  </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> We argue that the specification of an object's functional behavior and the timing constraints imposed  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> on it may be separated. Specifically, we describe  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> RTsynchronizer, a high-level programming language  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> construct for specifying real-time constraints between  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> objects in a distributed concurrent system. During program execution, RTsynchronizers affect the  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> scheduling of distributed objects to enforce real-time  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> relations between events. Objects in our system are  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> defined in terms of the actor model extended with  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> timing assumptions. Separation of the functional  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> behaviors of actors and the timing constraints on  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> patterns of actor invocation provides at least three  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> important advantages. First, it simplifies code development by separating design concerns. Second,  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> multiple timing constraints can be independently  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> specified and composed. And finally, a specification  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> of timing constraints can be reused even if the  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> representation of the functional behavior of actors has  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> changed, and conversely.  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> A number of examples are given to illustrate the  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> use of RTsynchronizers. These examples illustrate  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> how real-time constraints for periodic events, simultaneous events, exception handling, and producer-consumer may be specified.   </abstract>::line_number::29

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Concurrent systems maintain a distributed state and thus require coordination and synchronization between  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> components to ensure consistency. To provide a coherent design approach to concurrent systems, recent work  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> has employed an object-based methodology which emphasizes interactions through well-defined interfaces. The  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> Actor model has provided formal reasoning about distributed object systems. Nonetheless, due to the complex  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> interactions among components and the high volume of observable information produced, understanding and  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> reasoning about concurrent algorithms in terms of simple interactions is a difficult task. Coordination patterns,  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> which abstract over simple interactions, are not biased by low-level event orderings and are the appropriate  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> mechanism for reasoning about concurrent algorithms. We outline a methodology for visualizing coordination  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> patterns in concurrent algorithms which emphasizes observable interactions and causal connections between  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> objects. We introduce visualizers as a linguistic mechanism for mapping coordination patterns to visualization.  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> Visualizers are specified separately from algorithm code and thus respect code integrity. Moreover, visualizers  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> may be implemented strictly in terms of object interfaces and thus preserve object encapsulation.   </abstract>::line_number::23

<author>  Richard J. Edell, Nick McKeown and Pravin P. Varaiya   </author>::line_number::2
<abstract>  Abstract| This paper presents a system for billing users  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> for their TCP traffic. This is achieved by postponing the  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> establishment of connections while the user is contacted,  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> verifying in a secure way that they are prepared to pay. By  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> presenting the user with cost and price information, the system can be used for cost recovery and to encourage efficient  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> use of network resources. The system requires no changes to  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> existing protocols or applications and can be used to recover  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> costs between cooperating sites. Statistics collected from a  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> four day trace of traffic between the University of Califor-nia, Berkeley and the rest of the Internet demonstrate that  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> such a billing system is practical and introduces acceptable  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> latency. An implementation based on the BayBridge prototype router is described. Our study also indicates that  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> pricing schemes may be used to control network congestion  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> either by rescheduling time-insensitive traffic to a less expensive time of the day, or by smoothing packet transfers to  </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The aim of this paper is to explore intrinsic geometric methods of recovering the three  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> dimensional motion of a moving camera from a sequence of images. Generic similarities between  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the discrete approach and the differential approach are revealed through a parallel development  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> of their analogous motion estimation theories.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> We begin with a brief review of the (discrete) essential matrix approach, showing how to  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> recover the 3D displacement from image correspondences. The space of normalized essential  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> matrices is characterized geometrically: the unit tangent bundle of the rotation group is a  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> double covering of the space of normalized essential matrices. This characterization naturally  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> explains the geometry of the possible number of 3D displacements which can be obtained from  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> the essential matrix.  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> Second, a differential version of the essential matrix constraint previously explored by [19, 20]  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> is introduced. We then present the precise characterization of the space of differential essential  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> matrices, which gives rise to a novel eigenvector-decomposition-based 3D velocity estimation  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> algorithm from the optical flow measurements. This algorithm gives a unique solution to the  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> motion estimation problem and serves as a differential counterpart of the SVD-based 3D displacement estimation algorithm from the discrete case.  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> Finally, simulation results are presented evaluating the performance of our algorithm in terms  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> of bias and sensitivity of the estimates with respect to the noise in optical flow measurements.  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> The presented unifying theory of the motion estimation using discrete and differential version of the Longuet-Higgins (essential) constraint can be extended to the case of uncalibrated  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> cameras.   </abstract>::line_number::27

<abstract>  ABSTRACT  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> In this paper we present a prototype system for  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> the management of earth science data which is  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> novel in that it takes a DBMS centric view of the  </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract> shown in the context of its use by two geographically distributed scientific groups with demanding data storage and processing requirements.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> BigSur currently stores 1 Terabyte of data, about  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> one thousandth of the volume EOSDIS must  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> store. We claim that the design principles  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> embodied in BigSur provide sufficient exibility  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> to achieve the difficult scientific and technical  </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The increasing size and complexity of many software  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> systems demand a greater emphasis on capturing and  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> maintaining knowledge at many different levels within  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> the software development process. This knowledge includes descriptions of the hardware and software components and their behavior, external and internal design specifications, and support for system testing.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> The knowledge-based software engineering (KBSE) research paradigm is concerned with systems that use  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> formally represented knowledge, with associated inference procedures, to support the various subactivi-ties of software development. As they grow in scale,  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> KBSE systems must balance expressivity and inferential power with the real demands of knowledge base  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> construction, maintenance, performance and comprehensibility. Description Logics (DL's) possess several  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> features a terminological orientation, a formal semantics and efficient reasoning procedures which offer an effective tradeoff of these factors. We discuss  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> three KBSE systems in which DL's capture some of  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> the requisite knowledge needed to support design, coding and testing activities. We close with a discussion  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> of the benefits of DL's and ways to address some of  </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract> People can differentiate spoken languages  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> without understanding them, and, in some  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> sense, this differentiation can only be done  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> without understanding the language. When  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> we consider a multi-lingual person trying to  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> understand an utterance spoken in one of the  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> languages with which they are familiar, they  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> will first decide which language this utterance  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> belongs to, before trying to interpret it.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> The language identification task is one  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> example of high-level feature abstraction from  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> raw speech. Speech samples are classified  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> into categories according to what language  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> was spoken. We conjecture that this classification can be performed reliably and in real  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> time. To be successful, such a system should  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> be speaker-independent as well as context-independent. A large amount of training is  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> required to achieve a satisfactory level of performance.  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> We present a continuation of previous  </abstract>::line_number::25

<abstract> two important improvements to the system:  </abstract>::line_number::27

<keyword>  Keywords: Bayesian image restoration; Markov random fields; max flow-min cut   </keyword>::line_number::4
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> We consider the problem of maximum a posteriori (MAP) restoration of multicolor images  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> where each pixel has been degraded by independent arbitrary noise. We assume that the  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> prior distribution is given by a Markov random field with only pairwise site interactions.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Two classes of site interactions are considered: two-valued site interactions, which form a  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> generalized Potts model; and linear site interactions. We give efficient algorithms based on  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> graph cuts for both classes. The MAP estimate for a generalized Potts model can be computed by solving a multiway minimum cut problem on a graph. While this graph problem is  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> computationally intractable, there are fast algorithms for computing provably good approximations. The MAP estimate with linear site interactions can be computed exactly by solving  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> a minimum cut problem on a graph. This can be performed in nearly linear time.   </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> Query caching can play a vital role in heterogeneous, multi-database environments. Answers to a query that are available in cache  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> at the local client can be returned to the user  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> quickly, while the rest of the query is evaluated. The use of caches can optimize query  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> evaluation. By caching certain sensitive data  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> locally, caches can be used to answer the parts  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> of queries that involve the sensitive data, so it  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> need not be shipped across the network. Most  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> prior cache schemes have been tuple-based or  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> page-based. It is unclear, however, how these  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> might be adapted for multi-databases. We explore a more flexible semantic query caching  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> (SQC) approach. In SQC, caches are the answer sets of previous queries, labeled by the  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> query expressions that produced them. We  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> promote developing the technology, based on  </abstract>::line_number::26

<abstract>  Abstract. This paper develops a new I/O automaton model called the  </abstract>::line_number::4

<abstract> is based on the General Timed Automaton (GTA) of Lynch and Vaan-  </abstract>::line_number::6

<abstract> but that do not necessarily always exhibit this "normal" behavior. It can  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> be used for practical time performance analysis based on the stabilization  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> of the physical system.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> We use the Clock GTA automaton to model, verify and analyze the  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract> Consider an n-vertex, m-edge, undirected graph with maximum flow value v. We give a method to find augmenting  </abstract>::line_number::4

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> We consider a system of distributed processors that  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> communicate by passing messages and that have inexact information about time. Specifically, a processor knows that a single message is delayed by at most  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> time d and the time between any two of its consecutive steps is at least c 1 and at most c 2 ; it has no  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> other way of estimating elapsed time. This simple  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> model is very close to traditional models used in distributed computing theory, and has been studied by  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Attiya and Lynch [2, 1] among others. We extend  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the model by making a realistic assumption about  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> how the delay of messages is affected by the rate at  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> which they are sent. We define a model of message  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> links with bounded capacity, which are guaranteed to  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> deliver messages at only a given rate. If a processor sends messages at a greater rate, they may incur  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> greater delay.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> We quantify the effect of this bounded capacity on  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> the time necessary to detect processor failures. We  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> consider a system of two processors connected by a  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> bi-directional message link of (integral) capacity .  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> First we give two very simple protocols that guarantee any stopping failure will be detected within  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> time 2Cd + d and C 2 d= + Cd + d respectively,  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> where C = c 2 =c 1 . The main result is an almost-matching lower bound of 2Cd+d= or C 2 d=+Cd+d,  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> whichever is less. If the link is uni-directional, our result specializes to give a matching upper and lower  </abstract>::line_number::24

<title>  The Design and Implementation of SOLAR,  </title>::line_number::0

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> SOLAR is a portable high-performance library for out-of-core dense  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> matrix computations. It combines portability with high performance  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> by using existing high-performance in-core subroutine libraries and  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> by using an optimized matrix input-output library. SOLAR works on  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> parallel computers, workstations, and personal computers. It supports  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> in-core computations on both shared-memory and distributed-memory  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> machines, and its matrix input-output library supports both conventional I/O interfaces and parallel I/O interfaces. This paper discusses  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> the overall design of SOLAR, its interfaces, and the design of several  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> important subroutines. Experimental results show that SOLAR can  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> factor on a single workstation an out-of-core positive-definite symmetric matrix at a rate exceeding 215 Mflops, and an out-of-core general  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> matrix at a rate exceeding 195 Mflops. Less than 16% of the running  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> time is spent on I/O in these computations. These results indicate  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> that SOLAR's portability does not compromise its performance. We  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> expect that the combination of portability, modularity, and the use of  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> a high-level I/O interface will make the library an important platform  </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> We have implemented a prototype compiler called porch that transforms C programs into C programs supporting portable checkpoints. Portable checkpoints capture the state of a computation in  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> a machine-independent format that allows the transfer of computations across binary incompatible machines. We introduce source-to-source compilation techniques for generating code to save and  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> recover from such portable checkpoints automatically. These techniques instrument a program with code that maps the state of a computation into a machine-independent representation and vice versa.  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> In particular, the following problems are addressed: (1) providing  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> stack environment portability, (2) enabling conversion of complex  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> data types, and (3) rendering pointers portable. Experimental results show that the overhead of checkpointing is reasonably small,  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The "lasso"  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho  </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract> We describe a novel approach for image matching  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> based on deformable intensity surfaces. In this  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> approach, the intensity surface of the image  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> is modeled as a deformable 3D mesh in the  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> (x; ; I(x; )) space. Each surface point has 3  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract> within a class of objects (e.g. faces) are statistically learned through a Principal Components Analysis, thus providing a priori knowledge  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> about object-specific deformations. We demonstrate the power of the approach by examples  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract> This paper presents general algorithms for concurrency control in  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> tree-based access methods as well as a recovery protocol and a  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> mechanism for ensuring repeatable read. The algorithms are developed in the context of the Generalized Search Tree (GiST) data  </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> The problem we address is how to quickly estimate by simulation the loss in a  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> buffer with multiclass on-off Markov fluid sources. We generate the Markov fluids  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> with the altered rate matrices given in [11], instead of the originals, to speed up  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the simulation. Likelihood ratios are used to recover an estimate of the loss for the  </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract>  Abstract. We present a new diagnostic algorithm, based on backward-propagation, for localising design  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> errors in combinational logic circuits. Three hypotheses are considered, that cover all single gate replacement and insertion errors. Diagnosis-oriented test patterns are generated in order to rapidly reduce the  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> suspected area where the error lies. The originality of our method is the use of patterns which do not  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> detect the error, in addition to detecting patterns. A theorem shows that, in favourable cases, only two  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> patterns suffice to get a correction. We have implemented the test generation and diagnosis algorithms.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Results obtained on benchmarks show that the error is always found, after the application of a small  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> number of test patterns, with an execution time proportional to the circuit size.   </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> The simulation preorder on state transition systems is widely accepted as a  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> useful notion of refinement, both in its own right and as an efficiently checkable sufficient condition for trace containment. For composite systems, due to  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> the exponential explosion of the state space, there is a need for decomposing a  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> simulation check of the form P s Q into simpler simulation checks on the components of P and Q. We present an assume-guarantee rule that enables such a  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first assume-guarantee  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> rule that applies to a refinement relation different from trace containment. Our  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> rule is circular, and its soundness proof requires induction on trace-trees. The  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> proof is constructive: given simulation relations that witness the simulation  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> preorder between components, we provide a procedure for constructing a witness relation for P s Q. We also extend our assume-guarantee rule to account  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> for fairness assumptions on transition systems.   </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterization of the steady state throughput, as a function of loss rate and round trip time for a bulk transfer TCP flow, i.e., a flow with an unlimited amount  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> of data to send. Unlike the models in [6, 7, 10], our model captures not only the behavior of TCP's fast  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> retransmit mechanism (which is also considered in [6, 7, 10]) but also the effect of TCP's timeout mechanism on throughput. Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more timeout events than fast retransmit events.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP throughput and is  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> accurate over a wider range of loss rates.  </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> In the past few years there has been an increasing interest in workflow applications as a  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> way of supporting complex business processes in modern corporations. Given the nature  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> of the environment and the technology involved, workflow applications are inherently  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> distributed and pose many interesting challenges to the system designer. In most cases, a  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> client/server architecture is used in which knowledge about the processes being executed is  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> centralized in one node to facilitate monitoring, auditing, and to simplify synchronization.  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> In this paper, we explore a novel distributed architecture, Exotica/FMQM, for workflow  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> systems in which the need for such a centralized database is eliminated. Instead, we use  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> persistent messages as the means to store the information relevant to the execution of a  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> business process. Our approach is to completely distribute the execution of a process so  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> individual nodes are independent. The advantages of this approach are increased resilience  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> to failures and greater scalability and flexibility of the system configuration.   </abstract>::line_number::27

<abstract>  ABSTRACT  </abstract>::line_number::35
<abstract> The problem of source  </abstract>::line_number::36
<abstract> identification involves correctly  </abstract>::line_number::37
<abstract> classifying an incoming signal into  </abstract>::line_number::38
<abstract> a category that identifies the  </abstract>::line_number::39
<abstract> signal's source.  </abstract>::line_number::40
<abstract> The problem is difficult because  </abstract>::line_number::41
<abstract> information is not provided  </abstract>::line_number::42
<abstract> distinguishing characteristics and  </abstract>::line_number::43
<abstract> because successive signals from the  </abstract>::line_number::44
<abstract> same source differ. The source  </abstract>::line_number::45
<abstract> identification problem can be made  </abstract>::line_number::46
<abstract> more difficult by dynamically  </abstract>::line_number::47
<abstract> changing the repertoire of sources  </abstract>::line_number::48
<abstract> while the problem is being solved.  </abstract>::line_number::49
<abstract> We used genetic programming to  </abstract>::line_number::50
<abstract> evolve both the topology and the  </abstract>::line_number::51
<abstract> sizing (numerical values) for each  </abstract>::line_number::52
<abstract> component of an analog electrical  </abstract>::line_number::53
<abstract> circuit that can correctly classify an  </abstract>::line_number::54
<abstract> incoming analog electrical signal  </abstract>::line_number::55
<abstract> into three categories. Then, the  </abstract>::line_number::56
<abstract> repertoire of sources was  </abstract>::line_number::57
<abstract> dynamically changed by adding a  </abstract>::line_number::58
<abstract> new source during the run. The  </abstract>::line_number::59

<abstract> enabled genetic programming to  </abstract>::line_number::61
<abstract> adapt, during the run, to the  </abstract>::line_number::62
<abstract> changed environment. Specifically,  </abstract>::line_number::63
<abstract> a three-way source identification  </abstract>::line_number::64
<abstract> circuit was evolved and then  </abstract>::line_number::65

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Network throughput can be increased by allowing mul-tipath, adaptive routing. Adaptive routing allows more  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> freedom in the paths taken by messages, spreading load  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> over physical channels more evenly. The flexibility of  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> adaptive routing introduces new possibilities of deadlock. Previous deadlock avoidance schemes in k-ary n-cubes require an exponential number of virtual channels  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> [17]. We describe a family of deadlock-free routing algorithms, called planar-adaptive routing algorithms which  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> require only a constant number of virtual channels, independent of network size and dimension. Planar-adaptive  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> routing algorithms reduce the complexity of deadlock  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> prevention by reducing the number of choices at each  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> routing step. In the fault-free case, planar-adaptive  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> networks are guaranteed to be deadlock-free. In the  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> presence of network faults, the planar-adaptive router  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> can be extended with misrouting to produce a working network which remains provably deadlock free and  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> is provably livelock free. In addition, planar adaptive  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> networks can simultaneously support both in-order and  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> adaptive, out-of-order packet delivery.  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> Planar-adaptive routing is of practical significance. It  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> provides the simplest known support for deadlock-free  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> adaptive routing in k-ary n-cubes of more than two  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> dimensions (with k &gt; 2). Restricting adaptivity reduces the hardware complexity, improving router speed  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> or allowing additional performance-enhancing network  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> features. The structure of planar-adaptive routers is  </abstract>::line_number::29

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> The Xremote protocol is a compressed transformation of the X Window System protocol,  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> designed to efficiently implement X connections across relatively slow serial lines. Using an  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> Xremote simulator and 11 traces of X sessions, we found that Xremote's overall compression  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> ratio is 2.4:1. This figure varies widely depending on the trace. A study of compression  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> ratio as a function of message type shows text based messages commonly achieving 3:1  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> compression, while geometric messages usually achieve only 1.6:1 compression. By examining bandwidth requirements and compression performance as a function of time, we see  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> that Xremote performs adequately for some applications which are text based or which use  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> small geometric datasets, except at application startup where more bandwidth is required.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Further work is required to adequately support the initialization stage of X applications and  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> medium to large geometric databases.   </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> The aim of this paper is to identify and to characterize the features that render one class  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) computationally more efficient. Our approach  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> is to search for a causal structure not only in the topology of the subsets of variables upon  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> which the constraints are specified, but also in the nature of the constraints. Basically, there  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> should exist an ordering of variables in the system such that an assignment of the variables  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> can be reached without backtracking. First, an approach of a causal structure is formulated,  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> and second, an efficient procedure is provided (i) for deciding if such an ordering of variables  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> exists and, (ii) for identifying such an ordering whenever possible.   </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> This paper presents an approach to describing  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> group behavior using simple local interactions  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> among individuals. We propose that for a given  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> domain a set of basic interactions can be defined  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> which describes a large variety of group behaviors.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> The methodology we present allows for simplified  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> qualitative analysis of group behavior through the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> use of shared goals, kin recognition, and minimal  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> communication. We also demonstrate how these  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> basic interactions can be simply combined into  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> more complex compound group behaviors.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> To validate our approach we implemented an array of basic group behaviors in the domain of spatial interactions among homogeneous agents. We  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> describe some of the experimental results from two  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> distinct domains: a software environment, and a  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> collection of 20 mobile robots. We also describe  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> a compound behavior involving a combination of  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> the basic interactions. Finally, we compare the  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> performance of homogeneous groups to those of  </abstract>::line_number::26

<abstract>  Abstract: We exhibit a set of functions coded in  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Haskell that can be used as building blocks to construct  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> a variety of interpreters for Lisp-like languages. The  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> building blocks are joined merely through functional  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> composition. Each building block contributes code to  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> support a specific feature, such as numbers, continuations, functions calls, or nondeterminism. The result of  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> composing some number of building blocks is a parser,  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> an interpreter, and a printer that support exactly the  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> expression forms and data types needed for the combined set of features, and no more.  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> The data structures are organized as pseudomonads,  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> a generalization of monads that allows composition.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> Functional composition of the building blocks implies  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> type composition of the relevant pseudomonads.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> Our intent was that the Haskell type resolution system ought to be able to deduce the approprate data  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> types automatically. Unfortunately there is a deficiency  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> in current Haskell implementations related to recursive  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> data types: circularity must be reflected statically in the  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> type definitions.  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> We circumvent this restriction by applying a purpose-built program simplifier that performs partial evaluation  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> and a certain amount of program algebra. We construct  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> a wide variety of interpreters in the style of Wadler by  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> starting with the building blocks and a page of boiler-plate code, writing three lines of code (one to specify the  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> building blocks and two to (redundantly) specify type  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> compositions), and then applying the simplifier. The  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> resulting code is acceptable Haskell code.  </abstract>::line_number::31
<abstract> We have tested a dozen different interpreters with  </abstract>::line_number::32
<abstract> various combinations of features. In this paper we discuss the overall code structuring strategy, exhibit several building blocks, briefly describe the partial evaluator, and present a number of automatically generated  </abstract>::line_number::33

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> Multiple description coding (MDC) is source coding for multiple channels  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> such that a decoder which receives an arbitrary subset of the channels may produce a useful reconstruction. Orchard et al. [1] proposed a transform coding  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> method for MDC of pairs of independent Gaussian random variables. This paper provides a general framework which extends multiple description transform  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> coding (MDTC) to any number of variables and expands the set of transforms  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> which are considered. Analysis of the general case is provided, which can be  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> used to numerically design optimal MDTC systems. The case of two variables  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> sent over two channels is analytically optimized in the most general setting  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> where channel failures need not have equal probability or be independent. It  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> is shown that when channel failures are equally probable and independent, the  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> transforms used in [1] are in the optimal set, but many other choices are possible. A cascade structure is presented which facilitates low-complexity design,  </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract> Applications of learning to autonomous  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> agents (simulated or real) have often been  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> restricted to learning a mapping from perceived state of the world to the next action  </abstract>::line_number::5

<abstract> learning from no previous knowledge. This  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> general case for real autonomous robots is  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> very difficult. In any case, when building a  </abstract>::line_number::9

<abstract> knowledge (e.g., from the engineering that  </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> We describe a software package for computing and manipulating the subdivision of a sphere  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> by a collection of (not necessarily great) circles and for computing the boundary surface of the  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> union of spheres. We present problems that arise in the implementation of the software and the  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> solutions that we have found for them. At the core of the paper is a novel perturbation scheme to  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> overcome degeneracies and precision problems in computing spherical arrangements while using  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> floating point arithmetic. The scheme is relatively simple, it balances between the efficiency  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> of computation and the magnitude of the perturbation, and it performs well in practice. We  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> report and discuss experimental results. Our package is a major component in a larger package  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> aimed to support geometric queries on molecular models; it is currently employed by chemists  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> working in `rational drug design.' The spherical subdivisions are used to construct a geometric  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract: We identify a new polynomial time decidable fragment of first order  </abstract>::line_number::3

<title> Bayesian Approach for Learning to  </title>::line_number::4
<title> Recognize Objects   </title>::line_number::5
<author>  Paul A. Viola   </author>::line_number::6
<note>  This publication can be retrieved by anonymous ftp to publications.ai.mit.edu.   </note>::line_number::7
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> We have developed a new Bayesian framework for visual object  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> recognition which is based on the insight that images of objects can be  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> modeled as a conjunction of local features. This framework can be used  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> to both derive an object recognition algorithm and an algorithm for  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> learning the features themselves. The overall approach, called complex  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> feature recognition or CFR, is unique for several reasons: it is broadly  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> applicable to a wide range of object types, it makes constructing object  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> models easy, it is capable of identifying either the class or the identity  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> of an object, and it is computationally efficient requiring time proportional to the size of the image.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> Instead of a single simple feature such as an edge, CFR uses a large  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> set of complex features that are learned from experience with model  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> objects. The response of a single complex feature contains much more  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> class information than does a single edge. This significantly reduces the  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> number of possible correspondences between the model and the image.  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> In addition, CFR takes advantage of a type of image processing called  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> oriented energy. Oriented energy is used to efficiently pre-process the  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> image to eliminate some of the difficulties associated with changes in  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> lighting and pose.   </abstract>::line_number::26

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> The maximization of diversity of neuronal response properties has been recently suggested  </abstract>::line_number::8

<abstract> (Malach, 1994). We report a computational study of two aspects of this hypothesis. First, we  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> show that maximal diversity is attained when the ratio of dendritic and axonal arbor sizes is  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> equal to one, as it has been found in many cortical areas and across species (Lund et al., 1993;  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> Several early game-playing computer programs used forward pruning (i.e., the practice of  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> deliberately ignoring nodes that are believed unlikely to affect a game tree's minimax value),  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> but this technique did not seem to result in good decision-making. The poor performance of  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> forward pruning presents a major puzzle for AI research on game playing, because some version  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> of forward pruning seems to be "what people do," and the best chess-playing programs still do  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> not play as well as the best humans.  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> As a step toward deeper understanding of how forward pruning affects quality of play, in  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> this paper we set up a model of forward pruning on two abstract classes of binary game trees,  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> and we use this model to investigate how forward pruning affects the accuracy of the minimax  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> values returned. The primary result of our study is that forward pruning does better when there  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> is a high correlation among the minimax values of sibling nodes in a game tree.  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> This result suggests that forward pruning may possibly be a useful decision-making technique  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> in certain kinds of games. In particular, we believe that bridge may be such a game.   </abstract>::line_number::27

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> We describe an integrated problem solving architecture named INBANCA in  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> which Bayesian networks and case-based reasoning (CBR) work cooperatively on  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> multiagent planning tasks. This includes two-team dynamic tasks, and this paper  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> concentrates on simulated soccer as an example. Bayesian networks are used to characterize action selection whereas a case-based approach is used to determine how to  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> implement actions. This paper has two contributions. First, we survey integrations  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> of case-based and Bayesian approaches from the perspective of a popular CBR task  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> decomposition framework, thus explaining what types of integrations have been attempted. This allows us to explain the unique aspects of our proposed integration.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> Second, we demonstrate how Bayesian nets can be used to provide environmental  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> context, and thus feature selection information, for the case-based reasoner.   </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract> have been used for many applications in the area of distributed systems, including mutual exclusion,  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> data replication and dissemination of information  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> Given a strategy to pick quorums, the load L(S) is the minimal access probability of the busiest  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> element, minimizing over the strategies. The capacity Cap(S) is the highest quorum accesses rate  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> that S can handle, so Cap(S) = 1=L(S).  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> The availability of a quorum system S is the probability that at least one quorum survives,  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> assuming that each element fails independently with probability p. A tradeoff between L(S) and the  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> availability of S is shown.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> We present four novel constructions of quorum system, all featuring optimal or near optimal  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> load, and high availability. The best construction, based on paths in a grid, has a load of O(1=  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract> A data breakpoint associates debugging actions with  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> programmer-specified conditions on the memory state  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> of an executing program. Data breakpoints provide  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> a means for discovering program bugs that are tedious or impossible to isolate using control breakpoints  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> alone. In practice, programmers rarely use data break-points, because they are either unimplemented or prohibitively slow in available debugging software. In this  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> paper, we present the design and implementation of a  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> practical data breakpoint facility.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> A data breakpoint facility must monitor all memory  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> updates performed by the program being debugged.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> We implemented and evaluated two complementary  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> techniques for reducing the overhead of monitoring  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> memory updates. First, we checked write instructions  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> by inserting checking code directly into the program  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> being debugged. The checks use a segmented bitmap  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> data structure that minimizes address lookup complexity. Second, we developed data flow algorithms  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> that eliminate checks on some classes of write instructions but may increase the complexity of the remaining  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> checks.  </abstract>::line_number::21

<abstract> While plan recognition research has been applied to a  </abstract>::line_number::10

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> Reactive controllers has been widely used in mobile robots since they are able to achieve successful performance in real-time. However, the configuration of a reactive controller depends  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> highly on the operating conditions of the robot and the environment; thus, a reactive controller  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> configured for one class of environments may not perform adequately in another. This paper  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> presents a formulation of learning adaptive reactive controllers. Adaptive reactive controllers  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> inherit all the advantages of traditional reactive controllers, but in addition they are able to adjust themselves to the current operating conditions of the robot and the environment in order to  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> improve task performance. Furthermore, learning adaptive reactive controllers can learn when  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> and how to adapt the reactive controller so as to achieve effective performance under different  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> conditions. The paper presents an algorithm for a learning adaptive reactive controller that  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> combines ideas from case-based reasoning and reinforcement learning to construct a mapping  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> between the operating conditions of a controller and the appropriate controller configuration;  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> this mapping is in turn used to adapt the controller configuration dynamically. As a case  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> study, the algorithm is implemented in a robotic navigation system that controls a Denning  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> MRV-III mobile robot. The system is extensively evaluated using statistical methods to verify  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> its learning performance and to understand the relevance of different design parameters on the  </abstract>::line_number::24

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> In this paper we develop a framework for comparing  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> ontologies, and place a number of the more  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> prominent ontologies into it. We have selected 10  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> specific projects for this study, including general  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> ontologies, domain specific ones, and one knowledge  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> representation system. The comparison framework  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> includes general characteristics such as the purpose of  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> an ontology, its coverage (general or domain-specific), its size, and the formalism used. It also  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> includes the design process used in creating an  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> ontology and the methods used to evaluate it.  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> Characteristics that describe the content of an  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> ontology include taxonomic organization, types of  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> concepts covered, top-level divisions, internal  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> structure of concepts, representation of part-whole  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> relations, and the presence and nature of additional  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> axioms. Finally we consider what experiments or  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> applications have used the ontologies. Knowledge  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> sharing and reuse will require a common framework  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> to support interoperability of independently created  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> ontologies. Our study shows there is great diversity  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> in the way ontologies are designed and the way they  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> represent the world. By identifying the similarities  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> and differences among existing ontologies, we clarify  </abstract>::line_number::31
<abstract> the range of alternatives in creating a standard  </abstract>::line_number::32
<abstract> framework for ontology design.   </abstract>::line_number::33

<abstract>  Summary  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for evaluating expectations of functions of interest  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> under a target distribution . This is done by calculating averages over the sample path of a  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> Markov chain having as its stationary distribution. For computational efficiency, the Markov  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> chain should be rapidly mixing. This can sometimes be achieved only by careful design of the  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> transition kernel of the chain, on the basis of a detailed preliminary exploratory analysis of . An  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> alternative approach might be to allow the transition kernel to adapt whenever new features of   </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> are encountered during the MCMC run. However, if such adaptation occurs infinitely often, the  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> stationary distribution of the chain may be disturbed. We describe a framework, based on the  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> concept of Markov chain regeneration, which allows adaptation to occur infinitely often, but which  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> does not disturb the stationary distribution of the chain or the consistency of sample-path averages.   </abstract>::line_number::25

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> Many connectionist approaches to musical expectancy and music composition let the  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> question of What next? overshadow the equally important question of When next?. One cannot  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> escape the latter question, one of temporal structure, when considering the perception of musical  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> meter. We view the perception of metrical structure as a dynamic process where the temporal  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> organization of external musical events synchronizes, or entrains, a listeners internal processing  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> mechanisms. This article introduces a novel connectionist unit, based upon a mathematical model  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> of entrainment, capable of phase and frequency-locking to periodic components of incoming  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> rhythmic patterns. Networks of these units can self-organize temporally structured responses to  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> rhythmic patterns. The resulting network behavior embodies the perception of metrical structure.  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract> Model predictive control strategies generally focus on controlling plant outputs to setpoints; in  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> industry, however, a more desirable goal is maximizing a plants profitability. In principle, this can be  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> done by creating a plant model and maximizing profit with respect to the market prices of the plants  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> inputs and outputs, but in practice, such centralized approaches often cannot effectively be applied at  </abstract>::line_number::9

<abstract> decentralized optimization at the unit operations level by tearing process streams and coordinating the  </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract> that a traditional Lagrangean-based approach to this pricing fails for simple systems. Instead, we define  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract> the mechanical structure of input devices. We suggest that selecting an  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> appropriate input device for an interactive task requires looking beyond the  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> physical structure of devices to the deeper perceptual structure of the task, the  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> device, and the interrelationship between the perceptual structure of the task and  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> the control properties of the device. We affirm that perception is key to  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> understanding performance of multidimensional input devices on  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> multidimensional tasks. We have therefore extended the theory of processing of  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> perceptual structure to graphical interactive tasks and to the control structure of  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> input devices. This allows us to predict task and device combinations that lead to  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> better performance and hypothesize that performance is improved when the  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> perceptual structure of the task matches the control structure of the device. We  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> conducted an experiment in which subjects performed two tasks with different  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> perceptual structures, using two input devices with correspondingly different  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> control structures, a three-dimensional tracker and a mouse. We analyzed both  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> speed and accuracy, as well as the trajectories generated by subjects as they used  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> the unconstrained three-dimensional tracker to perform each task. The results  </abstract>::line_number::25

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Existing complexity measures from contemporary learning theory cannot be conveniently applied to specific learning problems (e.g., training sets). Moreover, they are typically non-generic,  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> i.e., they necessitate making assumptions about the way in which the learner will operate. The lack  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> of a satisfactory, generic complexity measure for learning problems poses difficulties for researchers  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> in various areas; the present paper puts forward an idea which may help to alleviate these. It  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> shows that supervised learning problems fall into two, generic, complexity classes only one of which  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> is associated with computational tractability. By determining which class a particular problem  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> belongs to, we can thus effectively evaluate its degree of generic difficulty.   </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract> The use of music as a means to automate the sculpting and movement of graphical objects is investigated. An interactive environment for producing musically-controlled  </abstract>::line_number::8

<abstract> and Latham's work in evolutionary art. The environment permits the creation of kernel objects using an interactive toolset. In addition to a basic set of morphological  </abstract>::line_number::10

<abstract>  Summary  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> This article presents a software-only solution to the synchronization problem for uniprocessors.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The idea is to execute atomic sequences without any hardware protection, and in the rare case  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> of pre-emption, to roll the sequence forward to the end, thereby preserving atomicity. One of  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the proposed implementations protects atomic sequences without any memory-accesses. This  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> is significant as it enables execution at CPU-speeds, rather than memory-speeds. The benefit of  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> this method increases with the frequency at which atomic sequences are executed. It therefore  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> encourages the building of systems with fine-grained synchronization. This has the additional  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> advantage of reducing average latency. Experiments demonstrate that this technique has the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> potential to outperform even the best hardware mechanisms. The main contribution of this article  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> is to discuss operating-system related issues of rollforward and to demonstrate its practicality,  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> both in terms of flexibility and performance.   </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> Conventional software radios take advantage of vastly improved A/D converters and DSP hardware. Our  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> approach, which we refer to as virtual radios, also depends upon high performance A/D converters. However,  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> rather than use DSPs, we have chosen to ride the curve of rapidly improving workstation hardware. We use  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> wideband digitization and then perform all of the digital signal processing in user space on a general purpose  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> workstation. This approach allows us to experiment with new approaches to signal processing that exploit the  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> hardware and software resources of the workstation. Furthermore, it allows us to experiment with different  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> ways of structuring systems in which the radio component of communication devices are integrated with  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> higher-level applications.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> This paper describes the design and performance of an environment we have constructed that facilitates building virtual radios and of two applications built using that environment. The environment consists of an I/O  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> subsystem that provides high bandwidth low latency user-level access to digitized signals and a programming  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> environment that provides an infrastructure for building applications. The applications, which exemplify  </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The correspondence problem in computer vision is basically a matching task between two or more sets of features. In this paper, we introduce a vectorized image  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> representation, which is a feature-based representation  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> where correspondence has been established with respect  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> to a reference image. The representation consists of two  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> image measurements made at the feature points: shape  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> and texture. Feature geometry, or shape, is represented  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> using the (x; ) locations of features relative to the some  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> standard reference shape. Image grey levels, or texture,  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> are represented by mapping image grey levels onto the  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> standard reference shape. Computing this representation  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> is essentially a correspondence task, and in this paper  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> we explore an automatic technique for "vectorizing" face  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> images. Our face vectorizer alternates back and forth  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> between computation steps for shape and texture, and a  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> key idea is to structure the two computations so that each  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> one uses the output of the other. In addition to describing the vectorizer, an application to the problem of facial  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> feature detection will be presented.   </abstract>::line_number::25

<abstract>  ABSTRACT  </abstract>::line_number::1
<abstract> Multipol is a library of distributed data structures designed for irregular applications, including those with asynchronous communication patterns. In this paper,  </abstract>::line_number::2
<abstract> we describe the Multipol runtime layer, which provides an efficient and portable abstraction underlying the data structures. It contains a thread system to express  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> computations with varying degrees of parallelism and to support multiple threads  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> per processor for hiding communication latency. To simplify programming in a mul-tithreaded environment, Multipol threads are small, finite-length computations that  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> are executed atomically. Rather than enforcing a single scheduling policy on threads,  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> users may write their own schedulers or choose one of the schedulers provided by  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Multipol. The system is designed for distributed memory architectures and performs  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> communication optimizations such as message aggregation to improve efficiency on  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> machines with high communication startup overhead. The runtime system currently  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> runs on the Thinking Machines CM5, Intel Paragon, and IBM SP1, and is being  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> ported to a network of workstations. Multipol applications include an event-driven  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> timing simulator [1], an eigenvalue solver [2], and a program that solves the phylogeny  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> problem [3].   </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> We present an approach for creating realistic synthetic views of existing architectural  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> scenes from a sparse set of still photographs. Our approach, which combines both geometry-based and image-based modeling and rendering techniques, has two components. The first  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> component is an easy-to-use photogrammetric modeling system which facilitates the recovery of a basic geometric model of the photographed scene. The modeling system is effective  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> and robust because it exploits the constraints that are characteristic of architectural scenes.  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> The second component is a model-based stereo algorithm, which recovers how the real scene  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> deviates from the basic model. By making use of the model, our stereo approach can robustly  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> recover accurate depth from image pairs with large baselines. Consequently, our approach  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> can model large architectural environments with far fewer photographs than current image-based modeling approaches. As an intermediate result, we present view-dependent texture  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> mapping, a method of better simulating geometric detail on basic models. Our approach  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> can recover models for use in either geometry-based or image-based rendering systems. We  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> present results that demonstrate our approach's abilty to create realistic renderings of architectural scenes from viewpoints far from the original photographs.  </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract>  Abstract. Object-Relational and Object-Oriented DBMSs allow  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> users to invoke time-consuming (expensive) methods in their  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> queries. When queries containing these expensive methods are run  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> on data with duplicate values, time is wasted redundantly computing methods on the same value. This problem has been studied in  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> the context of programming languages, where memoization is the  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> standard solution. In the database literature, sorting has been proposed to deal with this problem. We compare these approachesalong  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> with a third solution, a variant of unary hybrid hashing which we call  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Hybrid Cache. We demonstrate that Hybrid Cache always dominates memoization, and significantly outperforms sorting in many  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> instances. This provides new insights into the tradeoff between hashing and sorting for unary operations. Additionally, our Hybrid Cache  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> algorithm includes some new optimizations for unary hybrid hashing, which can be used for other applications such as grouping and  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> duplicate elimination. We conclude with a discussion of techniques  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> for caching multiple expensive methods in a single query, and raise  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> some new optimization problems in choosing caching techniques.   </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> This paper describes a practical path planner for  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> nonholonomic robots in environments with obstacles.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The planner is based on building a one-dimensional,  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> maximal clearance skeleton through the configuration  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> space of the robot. However rather than using the Eu-clidean metric to determine clearance, a special metric  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> which captures information about the nonholonomy of  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> the robot is used. The robot navigates from start to  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> goal states by loosely following the skeleton; the resulting paths taken by the robot are of low "complexity."  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> We describe how much of the computation can be done  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> off-line once and for all for a given robot, making for  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> an efficient planner. The focus is on path planning  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> for mobile robots, particularly the planar two-axle car,  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> but the underlying ideas are quite general and may be  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> applied to planners for other nonholonomic robots.   </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> The relative slowdown of DRAMs with respect to  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> processor speeds and the widespread use of SMP  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> machines have bolstered the reliance on processor caches  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> to provide good performance. As a result, optimizing  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> machines and software for caches have recently received  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> more attention. In addition, with the popularity of  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> extensible computing, which includes the object oriented  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> programming style, shared libraries, and Java based  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> computing, creating effective compilers has become  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> more challenging, with an increased reliance on more  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> dynamic techniques, such as profiling and runtime code  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> generation. This paper proposes a dynamic optimization  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> method called cache windowing to reduce conflict misses  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> in L1 instruction caches. Using a combination of  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> hardware and software support, cache windowing  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> integrates a RollCache (a direct-mapped cache enhanced  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> to support dynamic cache configuration) and a software  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> implemented FIFO caching policy. Together, both allow  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> a program to reposition procedures, dynamically and  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> efficiently, to eliminate cache conflicts. Experiments  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> show that this type of caching scheme can achieve miss  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> rates competitive to a 2-way set associative cache for  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> various programs. Currently, a high software overhead  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> exists to support a software caching policy, though  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> different compiler optimizations, such as inlining, may  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> help to reduce this. Such a system provides a more robust  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> runtime architecture that, potentially, may adapt better to  </abstract>::line_number::31
<abstract> a wider variety of environments.   </abstract>::line_number::32

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> The problem of belief changehow an agent should revise her beliefs upon learning new  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> informationhas been an active area of research in both philosophy and artificial intelligence.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> Many approaches to belief change have been proposed in the literature. Our goal is not to  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> introduce yet another approach, but to examine carefully the rationale underlying the approaches  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> already taken in the literature, and to highlight what we view as methodological problems in the  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> literature. The main message is that to study belief change carefully, we must be quite explicit  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> about the ontology or scenario underlying the belief change process. This is something that  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> has been missing in previous work, with its focus on postulates. Our analysis shows that we  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> must pay particular attention to two issues which have often been taken for granted: The first  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> is how we model the agent's epistemic state. (Do we use a set of beliefs, or a richer structure,  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> such as an ordering on worlds? And if we use a set of beliefs, in what language are these  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> beliefs are expressed?) The second is the status of observations. (Are observations known to  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> be true, or just believed? In the latter case, how firm is the belief?) For example, we argue that  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> even postulates that have been called beyond controversy are unreasonable when the agent's  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> beliefs include beliefs about her own epistemic state as well as the external world. Issues of the  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> status of observations arise particularly when we consider iterated belief revision, and we must  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> confront the possibility of revising by ' and then by :'.   </abstract>::line_number::31

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> Conditional logics play an important role in recent attempts  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> to investigate default reasoning. This paper investigates first-order conditional logic. We show that, as for first-order  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> probabilistic logic, it is important not to confound statistical conditionals over the domain (such as most birds fly),  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> and subjective conditionals over possible worlds (such as I  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> believe that Tweety is unlikely to fly). We then address  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> the issue of ascribing semantics to first-order conditional  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> logic. As in the propositional case, there are many possible semantics. To study the problem in a coherent way, we  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> use plausibility structures. These provide us with a general  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> framework in which many of the standard approaches can be  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> embedded. We show that while these standard approaches  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> are all the same at the propositional level, they are significantly different in the context of a first-order language. We  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> show that plausibilities provide the most natural extension of  </abstract>::line_number::31
<abstract> conditional logic to the first-order case: We provide a sound  </abstract>::line_number::32
<abstract> and complete axiomatization that contains only the KLM  </abstract>::line_number::33
<abstract> properties and standard axioms of first-order modal logic.  </abstract>::line_number::34
<abstract> We show that most of the other approaches have additional  </abstract>::line_number::35
<abstract> properties, which result in an inappropriate treatment of an  </abstract>::line_number::36
<abstract> infinitary version of the lottery paradox.   </abstract>::line_number::37

<abstract> Our implementations can be applied to a variety of disk,  </abstract>::line_number::27

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> This paper examines the plausibility of using a network of  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> workstations (NOW) for a mixture of parallel and sequential  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> jobs. Through simulations, our study examines issues that arise  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> when combining these two workloads on a single platform. Starting from a dedicated NOW just for parallel programs, we incrementally relax uniprogramming restrictions until we have a  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> multi-programmed, multi-user NOW for both interactive sequential users and parallel programs. We show that a number of issues  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> associated with the distributed NOW environment (e.g., daemon  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> activity, coscheduling skew) can have a small but noticeable effect on parallel program performance. We also find that efficient  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> migration to idle workstations is necessary to maintain acceptable parallel application performance. Furthermore, we present a  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> methodology for deriving an optimal delay time for recruiting idle  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> machines for use by parallel programs; this recruitment threshold  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> was just 3 minutes for the research cluster we measured. Finally,  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> we quantify the effects of the additional parallel load upon interactive users by keeping track of the potential number of user  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> delays in our simulations. When we limit the maximum number  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> of delays per user, we can still maintain acceptable parallel program performance. In summary, we find that for our workloads a  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> 2:1 rule applies: a NOW cluster of approximately 60 machines can  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> sustain a 32-node parallel workload in addition to the sequential  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> load placed upon it by interactive users.   </abstract>::line_number::24

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> The analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problem  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> for linguistic semantics and poses serious challenges for natural language processing systems.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> We argue for a compositional treatment of compound constructions which limits the need for  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> listing of compounds in the lexicon. We argue that the development of a practical model of  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> compound interpretation crucially depends on issues of lexicon design. The Generative Lexicon  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> (Pustejovsky 1995) provides us with a model of the lexicon which couples sufficiently expressive  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> lexical semantic representations with mechanisms which capture the relationship between those  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> representations and their syntactic expression. In our approach, the qualia structures of the  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> nouns in a compound provide relational structure enabling compositional interpretation of the  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> modification of the head noun by the modifying noun. This brings compound interpretation  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> under the same rubric as other forms of composition in natural language, including argument  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> selection, adjectival modification, and type coercion (Pustejovsky (1991,1995), Bouillon 1995).  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> We examine data from both English and Italian and develop analyses for both languages which use  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> phrase structure schemata to account for the connections between lexical semantic representation  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> and syntactic expression. In addition to applications in natural language understanding, machine  </abstract>::line_number::24

<author>  Patrick D. Lincoln John C. Mitchell Andre Scedrov x   </author>::line_number::1
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::2
<abstract> We present stochastic interactive semantics for propositional linear  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> logic without modalities. The framework is based on interactive  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> protocols considered in computational complexity theory, in which  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> a prover with unlimited power interacts with a verifier that can  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> only toss fair coins or perform simple tasks when presented with  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> the given formula or with subsequent messages from the prover.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The additive conjunction & is described as random choice, which  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> reflects the intuitive idea that the verifier can perform only "random spot checks". This stochastic interactive semantic framework  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> is shown to be sound and complete. Furthermore, the prover's  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> winning strategies are basically proofs of the given formula. In  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> this framework the multiplicative and additive connectives of linear logic are described by means of probabilistic operators, giving a  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> In this paper we present an extensive experimental study comparing three general-purpose graph  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> drawing algorithms. The three algorithms take as  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> input general graphs (with no restrictions whatsoever on the connectivity, planarity, etc.) and construct orthogonal grid drawings, which are widely  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> used in software and database visualization applications. The test data (available by anonymous  </abstract>::line_number::31
<abstract> ftp) are 11,582 graphs, ranging from 10 to 100  </abstract>::line_number::32
<abstract> vertices, which have been generated from a core  </abstract>::line_number::33
<abstract> set of 112 graphs used in "real-life" software engineering and database applications. The experiments provide a detailed quantitative evaluation of  </abstract>::line_number::34
<abstract> the performance of the three algorithms, and show  </abstract>::line_number::35
<abstract> that they exhibit trade-offs between "aesthetic"  </abstract>::line_number::36

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Relational database systems and most object-oriented database systems provide support for queries.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Usually these queries represent retrievals over sets or  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> multisets. Many new applications for databases, such  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> as multimedia systems and digital libraries, need support for queries on complex bulk types such as lists  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> and trees. In this paper we describe an object-oriented  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> query algebra for lists and trees. The operators in the  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> algebra preserve the ordering between the elements of a  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> list or tree, even when the result list or tree contains an  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> arbitrary set of nodes from the original tree. We also  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> present predicate languages for lists and trees which  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> allow order-sensitive queries because they use pattern  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> matching to examine groups of list or tree nodes rather  </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract> methods that decompose global planning problems into a number of local problems, solve the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> local problems separately, and then combine  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> the local solutions to generate a global solution. We present algorithms that decompose  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> planning problems into smaller problems given  </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract>  We are concerned with temporal reasoning problems where there is uncertainty about the order  </abstract>::line_number::5

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> This paper investigates the power of genetic algorithms at solving the MAX-CLIQUE problem. We measure the performance of a standard genetic algorithm on an elementary set of  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> problem instances consisting of embedded cliques in random graphs. We indicate the need  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> for improvement, and introduce a new genetic algorithm, the multi-phase annealed GA, which  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> exhibits superior performance on the same problem set.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> As we scale up the problem size and test on "hard" benchmark instances, we notice a  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> degraded performance in the algorithm caused by premature convergence to local minima. To  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> alleviate this problem, a sequence of modifications are implemented ranging from changes in  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> input representation to systematic local search. The most recent version, called union GA,  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> incorporates the features of union cross-over, greedy replacement, and diversity enhancement.  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> It shows a marked speed-up in the number of iterations required to find a given solution, as well  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> as some improvement in the clique size found.  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> We discuss issues related to the SIMD implementation of the genetic algorithms on a Thinking Machines CM-5, which was necessitated by the intrinsically high time complexity (O(n 3 ))  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> of the serial algorithm for computing one iteration.  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> Our preliminary conclusions are: (1) a genetic algorithm needs to be heavily customized to  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> work "well" for the clique problem; (2) a GA is computationally very expensive, and its use is  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> only recommended if it is known to find larger cliques than other algorithms; (3) although our  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> customization effort is bringing forth continued improvements, there is no clear evidence, at this  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> time, that a GA will have better success in circumventing local minima.   </abstract>::line_number::31

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Mitchell defined and axiomatized a subtyping relationship (also known  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> as containment, coercibility, or subsumption) over the types of System F  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> (with "!" and "8"). This subtyping relationship is quite simple and does  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> not involve bounded quantification. Tiuryn and Urzyczyn quite recently  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> proved this subtyping relationship to be undecidable. This paper supplies a new undecidability proof for this subtyping relationship. First, a  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> new syntax-directed axiomatization of the subtyping relationship is defined. Then, this axiomatization is used to prove a reduction from the  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> undecidable problem of semi-unification to subtyping. The undecidability of subtyping implies the undecidability of type checking for System F  </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> The purpose of these notes is to describe some of the physical and mathematical properties  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> of the equations occurring in global illumination. We first examine the physical assumptions  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> that make the particle model of light an appropriate paradigm for computer graphics and  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> then derive a balance equation for photons. In doing this we establish connections with the  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> field of radiative transfer and its more abstract counterpart, transport theory. The resulting  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> balance equation, known as the equation of transfer, accounts for large-scale interaction  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> of light with participating media as well as complex reflecting surfaces. Under various  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> simplifying assumptions the equation of transfer reduces to more conventional equations  </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract>  In this paper, we present an approach for the reconstruction of teeth model. Therefore,  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> a tooth model has to be scanned from several directions with a 3D-laser scanner. Several  </abstract>::line_number::6

<abstract> all acquired range views are combined to build a CAD-model of the tooth. The idea is  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> that every part of the surface should be visible in at least one view. The reconstruction  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> process is divided into the steps registration, volume sculpturing and generation of an  </abstract>::line_number::10

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> Industrial assembly involves sensing the pose (orientation and position) of a part. Efficient and reliable  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> sensing strategies can be developed for an assembly  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> task if the shape of the part is known in advance. In  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> this paper we investigate the problem of determining  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the pose of a convex n-gon from a set of m supporting  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> cones, i.e., cones with both sides supporting the polygon. An algorithm with running time O(nm) which  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> almost always reduces to O(n + m log n) is presented  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> to solve for all possible poses of the polygon. As a consequence, the polygon inscription problem of finding all  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> possible poses for a convex n-gon inscribed in another  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> convex m-gon, can be solved within the same asymptotic time bound. We prove that the number of possible poses cannot exceed 6n, given m 2 supporting  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> cones with distinct vertices. Experiments demonstrate  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> that two supporting cones are sufficient to determine  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> the real pose of the n-gon in most cases.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> Our results imply that sensing in practice can be  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> carried out by obtaining viewing angles of a planar  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> part at multiple exterior sites in the plane. As a conclusion, we generalize this and other sensing methods  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> into a scheme named sensing by inscription.   </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract> from middleware, operating system and networking services that can support QoS guarantees, high availability,  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> dynamic reconfigurability and scalability.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> In this paper, we propose a middleware layer called a "Real-Time Push-Pull Communications Service" to easily and quickly disseminate information across heterogeneous nodes with an underlying architecture to satisfy the  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> above-mentioned requirements. Push-Pull Communications is an extension of the real-time publisher/subscriber  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> model [4], and represents both "push" (data transfer initiated by a sender) and "pull" (data transfer initiated by a  </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Abstraction is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of problem  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description as  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> used in most hierarchical planners has proven useful. In this paper we present examples  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from  </abstract>::line_number::21

<abstract> Because the World Wide Web consists primarily of  </abstract>::line_number::9

<abstract> the suitability of relational learning in solving it. The  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> implementation of a general-purpose relational learner  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> for information extraction, SRV, is described. In contrast with earlier learning systems for information extraction, SRV makes no assumptions about document  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> structure and the kinds of information available for use  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> in learning extraction patterns. Instead, structural and  </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract> translation of French text to English text. Candide uses  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> methods of information theory and statistics to develop a  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> probability model of the translation process. This model,  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> which is made to accord as closely as possible with a large  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> body of French and English sentence pairs, is then used to  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> generate English translations of previously unseen French  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> sentences. This paper provides a tutorial in these methods,  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> discussions of the training and operation of the system, and  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> a summary of test results.   </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract. The design of linear logic programming languages and theorem provers opens a number of new implementation challenges not  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> present in more traditional logic languages such as Horn clauses (Prolog)  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> and hereditary Harrop formulas (Prolog). Among these, the problem of  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> efficiently managing the linear context when solving a goal is of crucial  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> importance for the use of these systems in non-trivial applications. This  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> paper studies this problem in the case of Lolli [6] (though its results have  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> application to other systems). We first give a proof-theoretic presentation of the operational semantics of this language as a resolution calculus.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> We then present a series of resource management systems designed to  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> eliminate the non-determinism in the distribution of linear formulas that  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> undermines the efficiency of a direct implementation of this system.   </abstract>::line_number::20

<title>  Fast Probabilistic Modeling for Combinatorial Optimization   </title>::line_number::8
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> Probabilistic models have recently been utilized for the optimization of large combinatorial search problems. However,  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> complex probabilistic models that attempt to capture inter-parameter dependencies can have prohibitive computational  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> costs. The algorithm presented in this paper, termed  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> COMIT, provides a method for using probabilistic models in  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> conjunction with fast search techniques. We show how  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> COMIT can be used with two very different fast search algorithms: hillclimbing and Population-based incremental  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> learning (PBIL). The resulting algorithms maintain many of  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> the benefits of probabilistic modeling, with far less computational expense. Extensive empirical results are provided;  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> COMIT has been successfully applied to jobshop scheduling, traveling salesman, and knapsack problems. This paper  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> also presents a review of probabilistic modeling for combi  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> natorial optimization.   </abstract>::line_number::20

<title>  New Approximation Techniques for Some Ordering Problems   </title>::line_number::0
<author>  Satish Rao Andrea W. Richa    </author>::line_number::1
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::2
<abstract> We describe logarithmic times optimal approximation  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> algorithms for the NP-hard graph optimization problems of minimum linear arrangement, minimum containing interval graph, and minimum storage-time  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> product. This improves on the best previous approximation bounds of Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber for  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> these problems by an (log log n) factor.  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber defined "spreading  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> metrics" for each of the ordering problems above (and  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> to other problems); for each of these problems, they  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> provided a spreading metric of volume W , such that W  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> is a lower bound on the cost of a solution to the problem.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> They used this spreading metric to find a solution of  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> cost O(W log n log log n) (for simplicity, assume that  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> all tasks have unit processing time in the minimum  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> storage-time product problem). In this paper, we show  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> how to find a solution within a logarithmic factor times  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> W for these problems.  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> We develop a recursion where at each level we  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> identify cost which, if incurred, yields subproblems  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> with reduced spreading metric volume. Specifically, we  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> present a divide-and-conquer strategy where the cost of  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> a solution to a problem at a recursive level is C plus the  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> cost of a solution to the subproblems at this level, and  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> where the spreading metric volume on the subproblems  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> is less than the original volume by (C= log n). This  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> ensures that the resulting solution has cost O(log n)  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> times the original spreading metric volume.  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> We note that this is an existentially tight bound on  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> the relationship between the spreading metric volume  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> W and the true optimal values for these problems.  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> For planar graphs, we combine a structural theorem  </abstract>::line_number::31
<abstract> of Klein, Plotkin, and Rao with our new recursion technique to show that the spreading metric cost volumes  </abstract>::line_number::32
<abstract> are within an O(log log n) factor of the cost of an optimal solution for the minimum linear arrangement, and  </abstract>::line_number::33
<abstract> the minimum containing interval graph problems.   </abstract>::line_number::34

<abstract> Rogue is an architecture built on a real robot which provides algorithms for the integration of high-level planning, low-level robotic execution, and learning. Rogue addresses successfully several of the  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> challenges of a dynamic office gopher environment. This article presents the techniques for the integration  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> of planning and execution.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Rogue uses and extends a classical planning algorithm to create plans for multiple interacting goals  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> introduced by asynchronous user requests. Rogue translates the planner's actions to robot execution  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> actions and monitors real world execution. Rogue is currently implemented using the prodigy4.0  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> planner and the Xavier robot. This article describes how plans are created for multiple asynchronous goals,  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> and how task priority and compatibility information is used to achieve appropriate efficient execution. We  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> describe how Rogue communicates with the planner and the robot to interleave planning with execution  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> so that the planner can replan for failed actions, identify the actual outcome of an action with multiple  </abstract>::line_number::18

<abstract> The World Wide Web (WWW) has recently become a very popular facility for the dissemination of  </abstract>::line_number::9

<abstract> machine servers cannot keep pace with the ever greater load being placed upon them. To alleviate this  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> problem, we have implemented a distributed Web server group. The server group can effectively balance request load amongst its members (within about 10% of optimal), and client response time is no  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> worse than in the single server case. Client response time was not improved because the measured client traffic consumed all available network throughput. The distributed operation of the server groups is  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract> Multimedia has generated widespread interest in real-time support within general purpose  </abstract>::line_number::10

<abstract>  Abstract.  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> This paper presents an analysis of the following load balancing algorithm. At each step, each node in a network examines the number  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> of tokens at each of its neighbors and sends a token to each neighbor with at least 2d + 1 fewer tokens, where d is the maximum degree  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> of any node in the network. We show that within O(=ff) steps, the algorithm reduces the maximum difference in tokens between any  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> two nodes to at most O((d 2 log n)=ff), where is the global imbalance in tokens (i.e., the maximum difference between the number of  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> tokens at any node initially and the average number of tokens), n is the number of nodes in the network, and ff is the edge expansion of  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> the network. The time bound is tight in the sense that for any graph with edge expansion ff, and for any value , there exists an initial  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> distribution of tokens with imbalance for which the time to reduce the imbalance to even =2 is at least (=ff). The bound on the  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> final imbalance is tight in the sense that there exists a class of networks that can be locally balanced everywhere (i.e., the maximum  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> difference in tokens between any two neighbors is at most 2d), while the global imbalance remains ((d 2 log n)=ff). Furthermore, we show  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> that upon reaching a state with a global imbalance of O((d 2 log n)=ff), the time for this algorithm to locally balance the network can be  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> as large as (n 1=2 ). We extend our analysis to a variant of this algorithm for dynamic and asynchronous networks. We also present tight  </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> This paper describes a media-independent, compositional, plan-based approach to representing attributive descriptions for use in integrated text and graphics generation. An attributive  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> description's main function is to convey information directly contributing to the communicative  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> goals of a discourse, whereas a referential description's only function is to enable the audience  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> to identify a particular referent. This approach has been implemented as part of an architecture  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> for generating integrated text and information graphics. Uses of referential and attributive descriptions are represented as two distinct types of communicative acts in a media-independent  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> plan. It is particularly important to distinguish the two types of acts, since they have different  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> consequences for dialogue and text generation, and for graphic design.   </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract. In this paper we describe a new method for automated tuning of high level parameters of supervised  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> learning systems. It uses memory-based learning principles and follows certain ideas of experimental design. The  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> described method allows not only for an efficient search through a decision space, but also for a concurrent validation  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> of the learning algorithm performance on a given data. Potential usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> with the Fuzzy-ARTMAP neural network application to learning a qualitative positioning of an indoor mobile robot  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> equipped with sonar range sensors. Automatically selected neural network setpoints reach a comparable performance  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> to those achieved by human experts in relatively simple 2D cases. Migration of the proposed method to higher order  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> optimization domains bears a big promise, but requires further research.   </abstract>::line_number::12

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Physically-based modeling has been used in the past to support a variety of interactive modeling tasks including free-form surface design, mechanism design, constrained drawing, and interactive camera control. In these systems, the user interacts with the model  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> by exerting virtual forces, to which the system responds subject  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> to the active constraints. In the past, this kind of interaction has  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> been applicable only to models that are governed by continuous  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> parameters. In this paper we present an extension to mixed con-tinuous/discrete models, emphasizing constrained layout problems  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> that arise in architecture and other domains. When the object being  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> dragged is blocked from further motion by geometric constraints, a  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> local discrete search is triggered, during which transformations such  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> as swapping of adjacent objects may be performed. The result of the  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> search is a nearby state in which the target object has been moved  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> in the indicated direction and in which all constraints are satisfied.  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> The transition to this state is portrayed using simple but effective animated visual effects. Following the transition, continuous dragging  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> is resumed. The resulting seamless transitions between discrete and  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> continuous manipulation allow the user to easily explore the mixed  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> design space just by dragging objects. We demonstrate the method  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> in application to architectural floor plan design, circuit board layout,  </abstract>::line_number::27

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> This paper explores the feasibility of using lottery scheduling, a proportional-share resource management algorithm,  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> to schedule processes under the FreeBSD operating system.  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Proportional-share scheduling enables flexible control over  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> relative process execution rates and processor load insulation among groups of processes. We show that a straight implementation of lottery scheduling performs worse than the  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> standard FreeBSD scheduler. This initial result prompted  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> us to extend lottery scheduling. Except for one test we  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> run, our resulting system performs within one percent of  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> the FreeBSD scheduler. We describe our design, evaluate  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> our implementation, and relate our experience in deploying  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> our lottery scheduler on production machines.   </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract> When documents are organized in a large  </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract> This paper shows that the accuracy of a naive  </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Memory latency is an important bottleneck in system performance  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> that cannot be adequately solved by hardware alone. Several promising software techniques have been shown to address this problem  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> successfully in specific situations. However, the generality of these  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> software approaches has been limited because current architectures  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> do not provide a fine-grained, low-overhead mechanism for  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> observing and reacting to memory behavior directly. To fill this  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> need, we propose a new class of memory operations called informing memory operations, which essentially consist of a memory  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> operation combined (either implicitly or explicitly) with a conditional branch-and-link operation that is taken only if the reference  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> suffers a cache miss. We describe two different implementations of  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> informing memory operationsone based on a cache-outcome  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> condition code and another based on low-overhead trapsand find  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> that modern in-order-issue and out-of-order-issue superscalar processors already contain the bulk of the necessary hardware support.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> We describe how a number of software-based memory optimizations can exploit informing memory operations to enhance performance, and look at cache coherence with fine-grained access  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> control as a case study. Our performance results demonstrate that  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> the runtime overhead of invoking the informing mechanism on the  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> Alpha 21164 and MIPS R10000 processors is generally small  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> enough to provide considerable exibility to hardware and software designers, and that the cache coherence application has  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> improved performance compared to other current solutions. We  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> believe that the inclusion of informing memory operations in  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> future processors may spur even more innovative performance  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> optimizations.   </abstract>::line_number::28

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> Neural networks have been successfully applied in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning applications. Neural-network methods are not commonly used for data-mining  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> tasks, however, because they often produce incomprehensible models and require long training  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> times. In this article, we describe neural-network learning algorithms that are able to produce  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> comprehensible models, and that do not require excessive training times. Specifically, we discuss  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> two classes of approaches for data mining with neural networks. The first type of approach,  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> often called rule extraction, involves extracting symbolic models from trained neural networks.  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> The second approach is to directly learn simple, easy-to-understand networks. We argue that,  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> given the current state of the art, neural-network methods deserve a place in the tool boxes of  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> data-mining specialists.   </abstract>::line_number::21

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> This paper describes an algorithm for simulating soft shadows at interactive rates using graphics hardware. On current graphics  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> workstations, the technique can calculate the soft shadows cast by moving, complex objects onto multiple planar surfaces in  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> about a second. In a static, diffuse scene, these high quality shadows can then be displayed at 30 Hz, independent of the number  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> and size of the light sources.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> For a diffuse scene, the method precomputes a radiance texture that captures the shadows and other brightness variations on  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> each polygon. The texture for each polygon is computed by creating registered projections of the scene onto the polygon from  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> multiple sample points on each light source, and averaging the resulting hard shadow images to compute a soft shadow image.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> After this precomputation, soft shadows in a static scene can be displayed in real-time with simple texture mapping of the  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> radiance textures. All pixel operations employed by the algorithm are supported in hardware by existing graphics workstations.  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> The technique can be generalized for the simulation of shadows on specular surfaces.   </abstract>::line_number::22

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> In this paper we present NIFDY, a network interface that uses admission control to reduce congestion and ensures that packets are  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> received by a processor in the order in which they were sent, even  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> if the underlying network delivers the packets out of order. The  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> basic idea behind NIFDY is that each processor is allowed to have at  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> most one outstanding packet to any other processor unless the destination processor has granted the sender the right to send multiple  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> unacknowledged packets. Further, there is a low upper limit on the  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> number of outstanding packets to all processors.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> We present results from simulations of a variety of networks  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> (meshes, tori, butterflies, and fat trees) and traffic patterns to verify NIFDY's efficacy. Our simulations show that NIFDY increases  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> throughput and decreases overhead. The utility of NIFDY increases  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> as a network's bisection bandwidth decreases. When combined  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> with the increased payload allowed by in-order delivery NIFDY increases total bandwidth delivered for all networks. The resources  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> needed to implement NIFDY are small and constant with respect to  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> network size.   </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> General media-processing programs are easily expressed with bit-addressing and variable-sized bit-fields. But the natural implementation of bit-addressing relies on dynamic shift offsets and repeated  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> loads, resulting in slow execution. If the code is specialized to the  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> alignment of the data against word boundaries, the offsets become  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> static and many repeated loads can be removed. We show how introducing modular arithmetic into an automatic compiler generator  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> enables the transformation of a program that uses bit-addressing  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> into a synthesizer of fast specialized programs.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> In partial-evaluation jargon we say: modular arithmetic is supported by extending the binding time lattice used by the static analysis in a polyvariant compiler generator. The new binding time  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> Cyclic functions like a partially static integer.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> A software cache combined with a fast, optimistic sharing analysis built into the compilers eliminates repeated loads and stores.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> The utility of the transformation is demonstrated with a collection  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> of examples and benchmark data. The examples include vector  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> arithmetic, audio synthesis, image processing, and a base-64 codec.   </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> Inversion of multilayer synchronous networks is a method which tries to answer questions  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> like "What kind of input will give a desired output?" or "Is it possible to get a desired  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> output (under special input/output constraints)?".  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> We will describe two methods of inverting a connectionist network. Firstly, we extend  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> inversion via backpropagation (Linden/Kindermann [4], Williams [11]) to recurrent (El-man [1], Jordan [3], Mozer [5], Williams/Zipser [10]), time-delayed (Waibel at al. [9])  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> and discrete versions of continuous networks (Pineda [7], Pearlmutter [6]). The result  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> of inversion is an input vector. The corresponding output vector is equal to the target  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> vector except a small remainder. The knowledge of those attractors may help to understand the function and the generalization qualities of connectionist systems of this  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> kind.  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> Secondly, we introduce a new inversion method for proving the non-existence of an  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> input combination under special constraints, e.g. in a subspace of the input space. This  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> method works by iterative exclusion of invalid activation values. It might be a helpful  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> way to judge the properties of a trained network.  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> We conclude with simulation results of three different tasks: XOR, morse signal decoding  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> and handwritten digit recognition.   </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> We describe our impressions of the SUPRENUM project and of its primary  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> supercomputer result, the Suprenum-1 prototype. We comment on the significance  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> of the architecture, its role among contemporary systems and its relevance to  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> current systems. We similarly discuss the SUPRENUM software and its impact on  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> distributed systems. Finally we discuss the successes and failures observed  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> throughout this exciting project and relate these to the organizational decisions on  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> which SUPRENUM was based.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> As an illustration of Suprenum-1 capabilities, we describe the  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> implementation of a fluid dynamical benchmark on the 256 node Suprenum-1  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> parallel computer. The benchmark, the Shallow Water Equations, is frequently used  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> as a model for both oceanographic and atmospheric circulation. We describe the  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> steps involved in implementing the algorithm on the Suprenum-1 and we provide  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> details of performance obtained. For such regular grid-based algorithms the system  </abstract>::line_number::19

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Given a set of training examples, determining the appropriate number of free parameters is a challenging problem. Constructive  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> learning algorithms attempt to solve this problem automatically by  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> adding hidden units, and therefore free parameters, during learning. We explore an alternative class of algorithms|called metamorphosis algorithms|in which the number of units is fixed, but  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the number of free parameters gradually increases during learning.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> The architecture we investigate is composed of RBF units on a lattice, which imposes flexible constraints on the parameters of the  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> network. Virtues of this approach include variable subset selection, robust parameter selection, multiresolution processing, and  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Recent work in feature-based classification has focused on non-parametric techniques that can classify instances even when the underlying feature distributions are  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> unknown. The inference algorithms for training these techniques, however, are designed  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> to maximize the accuracy of the classifier, with all errors weighted equally. In many  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> applications, certain errors are far more costly than others, and the need arises for  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> non-parametric classification techniques that can be trained to optimize task-specific  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> cost functions. This paper reviews the Linear Machine Decision Tree (LMDT) algorithm for inducing multivariate decision trees, and shows how LMDT can be altered to  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> We have studied the performance of a high-speed  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> commercial spread-spectrum wireless LAN that uses the  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> CSMA/CA multiple-access strategy. Employing synthetic workloads, we measured packet capture success  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> more so than signal propagation characteristics. Specifically, we measured throughput, packet loss rates, range,  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> and patterns of errors within packets. We conclude  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> that CSMA/CA is quite successful in allocating bandwidth under stress, but that packet capture rate degrades very quickly once the LAN's effective range is  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> exceeded. Hence, network maintainers should plan the  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> layout of wireless networks at least as carefully as they  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> plan wired networks.   </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> In this paper, we present new algorithms to balance  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> the computation of parallel hash joins over heterogeneous processors in the presence of data skew and external loads. Heterogeneity in our model consists of  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> disparate computing elements, as well as general purpose computing ensembles that are subject to external loading (e.g., a LAN connected workstation cluster). Data skew manifests itself as significant non-uniformities in the distribution of attribute values of  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> underlying relations that are involved in a join.  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> We develop cost models and predictive dynamic  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> load balancing protocols to detect imbalance during  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> the computation of a single large join. New predictive bucket scheduling algorithms are presented that  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> smooth out the load over the entire ensemble by reallocating buckets whenever imbalance is detected. Our  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> algorithms can account for imbalance due to data skew  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> as well as heterogeneity in the computing environment.  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> Significant performance gains are reported for a wide  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> range of test cases on a prototype implementation of  </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> In this paper we discuss a data mining framework for constructing intrusion detection models.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The key ideas are to mine system audit data for consistent and useful patterns of program and  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> user behavior, and use the set of relevant system features presented in the patterns to compute  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> (inductively learned) classifiers that can recognize anomalies and known intrusions. Our past experiments showed that classifiers can be used to detect intrusions, provided that sufficient audit  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> data is available for training and the right set of system features are selected. We propose to use  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> the association rules and frequent episodes computed from audit data as the basis for guiding the  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> audit data gathering and feature selection processes. We modify these two basic algorithms to use  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> axis attribute(s) as a form of item constraints to compute only the relevant (useful) patterns, and  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> an iterative level-wise approximate mining procedure to uncover the low frequency (but important)  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> patterns. We report our experiments in using these algorithms on real-world audit data.   </abstract>::line_number::17

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> In this paper we study the issue of how to scale machine learning algorithms, that  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> typically are designed to deal with main-memory based datasets, to efficiently learn  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> models from large distributed databases. We have explored an approach called meta-learning that is related to the traditional approaches of data reduction commonly  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> employed in distributed database query processing systems. We explore the scalability  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> of learning arbiter and combiner trees from partitioned data. Arbiter and combiner  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> trees integrate classifiers trained in parallel from small disjoint subsets. Previous work  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> demonstrated the efficacy of these meta-learning architectures in terms of accuracy  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> of the computed meta-classifiers. Here we discuss the computational performance  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> of constructing arbiter and combiner trees in terms of speedup and scalability as a  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> function of database size and number of partitions. The performance of serial learning  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> algorithms is evaluated. We then analyze the performance of the algorithms used to  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> construct combiner and arbiter trees in parallel. Our empirical results validate these  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> analyses and indicate that the techniques can effectively scale up to large datasets with  </abstract>::line_number::28

<abstract> and provide a performance comparison to the most widely  </abstract>::line_number::14

<title>  On-Line Search in a Simple Polygon   </title>::line_number::0
<author>  Jon M. Kleinberg    </author>::line_number::1
<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::2
<abstract> We consider a number of search and exploration problems, from the perspective of  </abstract>::line_number::3
<abstract> robot navigation in a simple polygon. These problems are "on-line" in the sense that  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> the robot does not have access to the map of the polygon; it must make decisions as it  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> proceeds, based only on what it has seen so far. For the problem of exploring a simple  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> rectilinear polygon (under the L 1 norm), Deng, Kameda, and Papadimitriou give a  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> 2-competitive deterministic algorithm; we present a randomized exploration algorithm  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> which is 5=4-competitive. Using similar techniques, we are able to give an algorithm  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> for searching an arbitrary, unknown rectilinear polygon. No constant competitive ratio  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> is attainable in this case, but our algorithm is within a constant factor of optimal in  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> the worst case; in a sense, it is a generalization of some of the strategies of Baeza-Yates, Culberson, and Rawlins to a much more general class of search spaces. Finally,  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> we examine a type of polygon for which competitive search is possible | the class of  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> "streets" considered by Klein, who gave a 1 + 3  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> 2 -competitive algorithm for the search  </abstract>::line_number::15

<abstract> We consider the problem of planning sensor control strategies that enable a  </abstract>::line_number::11

<abstract> robust and efficient algorithms for computing the regions from which a sensor  </abstract>::line_number::13

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) plays a key role in many areas of computational science  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> and engineering. Although most one-dimensional FFT problems can be entirely solved entirely in  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> main memory, some important classes of applications require out-of-core techniques. For these,  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> use of parallel I/O systems can improve performance considerably. This paper shows how to  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> perform one-dimensional FFTs using a parallel disk system with independent disk accesses. We  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> present both analytical and experimental results for performing out-of-core FFTs in two ways:  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> using traditional virtual memory with demand paging, and using a provably asymptotically  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> optimal algorithm for the Parallel Disk Model (PDM) of Vitter and Shriver. When run on a  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> DEC 2100 server with a large memory and eight parallel disks, the optimal algorithm for the  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> PDM runs up to 144.7 times faster than in-core methods under demand paging. Moreover, even  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> including I/O costs, the normalized times for the optimal PDM algorithm are competitive, or  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> better than, those for in-core methods even when they run entirely in memory.   </abstract>::line_number::20

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Agent Tcl is a transportable agent system. The agents are written in an extended version of the  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Tool Command Lanuage (Tcl). Each agent can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point, transport  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> to another machine and resume execution on the new machine. This migration is accomplished with  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the agent jump command. agent jump captures the current state of the Tcl script and transfers this  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> state to the destination machine. The state is restored on the new machine and the Tcl script continues  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> its execution from the command immediately after the agent jump. In addition to migration, agents  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> can send messages to each other and can establish direct connections. A direct connection is more  </abstract>::line_number::14

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> Given a set of n points, what is the description complexity of their convex hull? In our world, this question  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> is understood with an implicit "in the worst case", and the answer is n bd=2c where d is the dimension of  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> the underlying space. This is not entirely satisfactory, as this description complexity can vary tremendously  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> depending on the positions of the points. Another approach is to look at the expected description complexity  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> when the points are drawn from a given distribution. This type of analysis, initiated by Renyi and Sulanke  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> [RS63] and pursued by others gets its value from the fact that this expectation is in general much smaller  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> than in the worst case, and, more importantly, in that it often allows one to design algorithms that have  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> expected running times against which worst case aware algorithms cannot compete. For instance, the convex  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> hull of n points drawn independently uniformly at random from a d-dimensional hypercube has expected  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> complexity O(log d1 n), and can be computed in expected linear time.  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> In parallel, in the past decade, a number of papers have considered a setting where points are allowed  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> to move along low degree algebraic trajectories. Different questions have been asked in this context. In  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> particular, Atallah [Ata85], studied the number of times the combinatorial description of the convex hull  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> or closest pair can change, in the worst case ("dynamic computational geometry"). More recently, Basch,  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> Guibas, and Hershberger [BGH97] have designed kinetic data structures to maintain these attributes in an  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> online setting, measuring the quality of a kinetic data structure by the ratio of the worst case number of  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> changes to the configuration of interest, to the worst case number of changes to the data structure itself, for  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> low degree algebraic motions. However, an experimental study undertaken in [BGSZ97] to assess the quality  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> of these data structures in practice shows that the worst case analysis can hide vastly different results in  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> terms of expectation when the point positions and speeds are drawn at random from some distributions. It  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> is this study that motivated the present paper.  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> In this communication, we report several results on the expected number of changes to various combinatorial structures for the case when points are drawn from the uniform distribution on the unit square. These  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> results can be generalized for any dimension d &gt; 2.   </abstract>::line_number::31

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> The geometric point set matching problem in 2 and 3 dimensions is a well-studied problem with application to areas such as computer vision and pattern recognition, computational chemistry and other fields  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> such as cartography and computer animation. The basic problems can be formulated as follows. Given  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> some choice of a space of transformations and a similarity measure d(P; Q) for two point sets P and Q in  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> Euclidean space.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> Problem 1 (Pattern Matching (PM)) Given point sets P and Q, where jP j = k and jQj = n with  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> k n, and an * &gt; 0, find a transformation T for which d(T (P ); Q) * or return none if no such T exists.  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> Problem 2 (Largest Common Point-set (LCP)) Given point sets P and Q, where jP j = m and jQj =  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> n, K &gt; 0 and * &gt; 0, find a transformation T and a set P 0 P of size jP 0 j K such that jd(T (P 0 ); Q)j *  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> or return none if no such T and P 0 exist.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> We restrict T to the space of rigid Euclidean translations and rotations. The similarity measures of interest  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> to us are: the exact metric 1 d E (P; Q) (binary-valued, requiring each point in P to be mapped to a point in  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> Q); the Hausdorff metric d H (P; Q) (maximum over all points in P of the distance to the nearest point in  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> Q); and, the matching metric d M (bottleneck matching distance).  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> A detailed study of this set of problems was initiated by Alt, Mehlhorn, Wagener, and Welzl [AMWW88].  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> In this seminal work, they propose a suite of algorithms for the exact and matching metrics. More recent work  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> led to improved bounds for pattern matching and LCP under the exact metric. The problem of estimating  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> the minimum Hausdorff distance between two point sets in 2 and 3 dimensions has been studied extensively.  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> Clearly, any real application of such algorithms has to deal with the presence of noise in data, requiring  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> the algorithms to perform matching within the limits of some reasonable noise model. In fact, our interest  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> in these problems arose during an attempt to implement such algorithms for applications in computer vision  </abstract>::line_number::27
<abstract> and in computational biology and chemistry, particularly rational drug design [FKL + 97]. We discovered that  </abstract>::line_number::28
<abstract> noise present in real data rendered most known algorithms inoperative. In hindsight, this is not surprising  </abstract>::line_number::29
<abstract> for, as noted in the survey by Alt and Guibas [AG96], these algorithms are likely to be "difficult to implement  </abstract>::line_number::30
<abstract> and numerically unstable due to the necessary computation of intersections of complex algebraic surfaces."  </abstract>::line_number::31
<abstract> Worse still, they have unacceptably high running times: for example, even in R 2 , LCP under the matching  </abstract>::line_number::32
<abstract> metric requires O(n 8 ) time, although under additional restrictions on noise regions the running times can be   </abstract>::line_number::33

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> Classification is a key function of many "business  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> intelligence" toolkits and a fundamental building block  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> in data mining. Immense data may be needed to train  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> a classifier for good accuracy. The state-of-art classifiers [21, 25] need an in-memory data structure of  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> size O(N ), where N is the size of the training data,  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> to achieve efficiency. For large data sets, such a data  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> structure will not fit in the internal memory. The best  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> previously known classifier does a quadratic number of  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> I/Os for large N .  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> In this paper, we propose a novel classification algorithm (classifier) called MIND (MINing in  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> Databases). MIND can be phrased in such a way that  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> its implementation is very easy using the extended relational calculus SQL, and this in turn allows the classifier to be built into a relational database system directly. MIND is truly scalable with respect to I/O efficiency, which is important since scalability is a key  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> requirement for any data mining algorithm.  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> We built a prototype of MIND in the relational  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> database manager DB2 and benchmarked its performance. We describe the working prototype and report  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> the measured performance with respect to the previous  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> method of choice. MIND scales not only with the size  </abstract>::line_number::23
<abstract> of the datasets but also with the number of processors  </abstract>::line_number::24
<abstract> on an IBM SP2 computer system. Even on uniproces-sors, MIND scales well beyond the dataset sizes previously published for classifiers. We also give some  </abstract>::line_number::25
<abstract> insights that may have an impact on the evolution of  </abstract>::line_number::26
<abstract> the extended relational calculus SQL.   </abstract>::line_number::27

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> Reinforcement learning is the problem of generating optimal behavior in a sequential decision-making environment given the opportunity of  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> interacting with it. Many algorithms for solving reinforcement-learning  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> problems work by computing improved estimates of the optimal value  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> function. We extend prior analyses of reinforcement-learning algorithms  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> and present a powerful new theorem that can provide a unified analysis of  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> value-function-based reinforcement-learning algorithms. The usefulness  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> of the theorem lies in how it allows the asynchronous convergence of a  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> complex reinforcement-learning algorithm to be proven by verifying that  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> a simpler synchronous algorithm converges. We illustrate the application  </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract> images with sets of overlapping layers. Each  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> layer contains an intensity map that defines the  </abstract>::line_number::8

<abstract> The topology and physical characteristics of the upstream channel present new challenges for efficient  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> channel access. We present a media access protocol  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> that efficiently transfers data on this channel. A primary goal in the design was to keep the portion of the  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> protocol resident in the station as simple as possible.  </abstract>::line_number::16
<abstract> Thus we use centralized control located in the cable  </abstract>::line_number::17
<abstract> head-end and minimize intelligence in the station. We  </abstract>::line_number::18
<abstract> refer to this protocol as Centralized Priority Reservation or CPR. A station wishing to transmit sends a request to the head-end using a contention channel. The  </abstract>::line_number::19
<abstract> head-end acknowledges the request and then schedules  </abstract>::line_number::20
<abstract> the request, informing the station by means of a grant  </abstract>::line_number::21
<abstract> message when to transmit.  </abstract>::line_number::22
<abstract> The protocol performs well under heavy load. Performance is affected little by the number of stations,  </abstract>::line_number::23

<abstract> movies are under-utilized; also, good performance requires that movies be replicated to reflect the user  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> request pattern. Next, we examine disk farms in which movies are striped across disks, and find that  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> striped video servers offer close to full utilization of the disks by achieving better load balancing. Finally, we  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> evaluate the use of storage hierarchies for video service that include a tertiary library along with a disk farm.  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> Unfortunately, we show that the performance of neither magnetic tape libraries nor optical disk jukeboxes  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> as part of a storage hierarchy is adequate to service the predicted distribution of movie accesses. We suggest  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> changes to tertiary libraries that would make them better-suited to these applications.   </abstract>::line_number::13

<title>  Evaluating Blocking Probability in Generalized  </title>::line_number::0
<title> Connectors   </title>::line_number::1
<author>  Ellen Witte Zegura   </author>::line_number::2
<abstract>  Abstract| Generalized connectors provide the capability to connect a single input to one or more outputs. Such networks play an important role in supporting any application that involves the distribution of information from one source to many destinations or many sources to many destinations. We present the first analytic model for evaluating blocking probability in generalized connectors. The model allows flexibility in specifying traffic fanout characteristics and network routing algorithms. Equations are derived for computing blocking probability for the important class of series-parallel networks. We investigate the accuracy of the equations by comparing the blocking probability computed using the equations to results from simulation.   </abstract>::line_number::3

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> We examine using a CASE tool, Interactive Development Environment's Software through Pictures (StP), to support reverse engineering. We generate structure charts in StP from the automated analysis  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> of C source code. The advantages of this approach are that one can use  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> the CASE tool's support for drawing, linking, and modifying pictorial  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> notations for program design in order to make it easier to construct a  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> reverse engineering tool. Additionally, one can then use the design rep  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> resentations with the CASE tool to do reengineering for maintenance.   </abstract>::line_number::10

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> Association rules, introduced by Agrawal, Imielinski, and  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> Swami, are rules of the form "for 90 % of the rows of the  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> relation, if the row has value 1 in the columns in set W ,  </abstract>::line_number::9
<abstract> then it has 1 also in column B". Efficient methods exist for  </abstract>::line_number::10
<abstract> discovering association rules from large collections of data.  </abstract>::line_number::11
<abstract> The number of discovered rules can, however, be so large  </abstract>::line_number::12
<abstract> that browsing the rule set and finding interesting rules from  </abstract>::line_number::13
<abstract> it can be quite difficult for the user. We show how a simple  </abstract>::line_number::14
<abstract> formalism of rule templates makes it possible to easily describe the structure of interesting rules. We also give examples of visualization of rules, and show how a visualization  </abstract>::line_number::15
<abstract> tool interfaces with rule templates.   </abstract>::line_number::16

<abstract>  Abstract  </abstract>::line_number::4
<abstract> We describe a database system for writing, editing, and querying structured documents. The structure of text is described using a context-free  </abstract>::line_number::5
<abstract> grammar. The operations are implemented using a powerful query language. The system supports the use of user-defined multiple views of the  </abstract>::line_number::6
<abstract> documents: one view can contain all the structure explicitly, while another  </abstract>::line_number::7
<abstract> can contain only part of the document and have only part of the structure visible. This makes the system flexible for different editing tasks.  </abstract>::line_number::8
<abstract> The system is implemented in C using a relational database system.   </abstract>::line_number::9
