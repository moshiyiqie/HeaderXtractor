Collision avoidance is an important topic in multi-robot -><abstract>
systems. Existing multi-robot pathfinding approaches ig- -><abstract>
nore sideswipe collisions among robots (i.e., only consider -><abstract>
the collision which two agents try to occupy the same node -><abstract>
during the same time-step) [1, 3, 4], and allow diagonal move -><abstract>
between two adjacent nodes (e.g., Figure 1(b)). However, in -><abstract>
many real world applications, sideswipe collisions may also -><abstract>
block robots’ movements or cause deadlocks. For example, -><abstract>
as shown in Figure 1, if the size of two robots is as big as -><abstract>
the grid size they occupied, collisions will happen not only -><abstract>
between robots R1 and R2 in the situation depicted in Fig- -><abstract>
ure 1(a), but also that in Figure 1(b), which is typically not -><abstract>
considered as a collision in existing multi-robot systems. -><abstract>

To overcome the limitation depicted in Figure 1(b), we -><abstract>
investigate all possible collision scenarios in a multi-robot -><abstract>
system (the speed / velocity of robots is taken into consider- -><abstract>

ing, and identify one deadloop type and five collision types. -><abstract>
Other collision types involving non-movement of robots due -><abstract>
to breakdown are not included in our scenarios. We claim -><abstract>
that all possible scenarios that may hinder a robot’s planned -><abstract>
motion in a two-dimensional space can be covered by these -><abstract>
