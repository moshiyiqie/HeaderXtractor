Within the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, the sub- -><abstract>
field of Computational Social Choice considers the application of -><abstract>
AI techniques to problems in Social Choice [3]. Social Choice is -><abstract>
the theoretical study of elections and voting systems, and is some- -><abstract>
times referred to as “Voting Theory” instead. It has historical roots -><abstract>
in 18th century academics’ attempts to determine which voting sys- -><abstract>
tem was most representative of the will of the electorate, and was -><abstract>
formalized starting in the 1940’s. Important results include Arrow’s -><abstract>
theorem and the Gibbard-Satterwaithe theorem. The former shows -><abstract>
that no single voting system could satisfy 4 axiomatic requirements -><abstract>
for fairness, while still producing a definite outcome for every elec- -><abstract>
tion [1]. The latter shows that a similar set of axioms also necessi- -><abstract>
tated strategic behavior among voters — there is always a potential -><abstract>
advantage from casting a ballot that differs from your true prefer- -><abstract>

Starting in the early 1990’s, computer scientists began to take an -><abstract>
interest in social choice. Initial work was concerned with circum- -><abstract>
venting the impossibility result implied by the Gibbard-Satterwaithe -><abstract>
theorem using computational hardness. This work showed that, in -><abstract>
many voting systems, a strategic voter would need to solve an NP- -><abstract>
Hard problem to determine how best to cast its ballot [2]. -><abstract>
