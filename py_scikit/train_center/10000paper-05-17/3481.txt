ABSTRACT -><abstract>
The multi-core revolution has brought forth the pressing issue of -><abstract>
deciding where in the curriculum to introduce parallel program- -><abstract>
ming. At least 3 different strategies can be found, including the cur- -><abstract>
rent one used, where concurrent programming is taught in -><abstract>
Operating Systems. It is the position of this paper that we can -><abstract>
embrace the 3 strategies and present parallelism as a fundamental -><abstract>
notion in computing throughout the curriculum. We analyse curric- -><abstract>
ulum directions, present parameters to consider to introduce paral- -><abstract>
lelism, as well as a spiral approach to the subject starting in CS2. -><abstract>
