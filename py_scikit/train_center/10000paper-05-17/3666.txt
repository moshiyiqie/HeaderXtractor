PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><affiliation>
Wireless ad hoc networks routing protocols rely on tradi- -><abstract>
tional broadcast (flooding) in route establishment. Many -><abstract>
nodes will rebroadcast the packet. Valuable network re- -><abstract>
sources (e.g., battery power) can be consumed in flooding. -><abstract>
In this paper, we will propose Vectorized Broadcast Routing -><abstract>
(VBR) as an enhancement for LAR scheme 1 to reduce -><abstract>
the broadcast. In case of discovery phase failure, VBR will -><abstract>
enlarge the broadcast region again around the destination, -><abstract>
unlike LAR where the network will be flooded with this re- -><abstract>
quest again. Simulation results show that VBR can decrease -><abstract>
the number of routing packets by about one-third compared -><abstract>
to LAR. -><abstract>
BACKGROUND AND RELATED LITRATURE -><abstract>
Routing protocols in mobile ad hoc networks -><abstract>
(MANET)[1, 2] take into consideration the dynamic -><abstract>
topology and nodes movement. Unlike in wired network, -><abstract>
in MANET every node must act as a router and forward -><abstract>
the packets on behalf of the other nodes. The route -><abstract>
between the nodes will change and may break. Broadcast -><abstract>
plays a great role in MANET routing protocols. Due to -><abstract>
limitation in node resources and network shared medium, -><abstract>
broadcast consumes valuable resources. Thus, traditional -><abstract>
broadcast technique is considered a waste for the resources. -><abstract>
Therefore, minimizing the number of the broadcast events -><abstract>
in MANET is an active research area in the field of -><abstract>
resource management. Location information can offer great -><abstract>
