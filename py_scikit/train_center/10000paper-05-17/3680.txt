ABSTRACT -><abstract>
Access to systems that need protection is usually restricted by -><abstract>
asking the user to prove her identity and to authenticate. -><abstract>
Combination of user name and password (or PIN) is the most -><abstract>
common technique used for this purpose. Unfortunately, user- -><abstract>
name/password based authentication is vulnerable to various -><abstract>
types of password guessing attacks. Some techniques of making -><abstract>
password guessing very difficult do exist. With these techniques, -><abstract>
policies for very strong passwords can be avoided, however, they -><abstract>
usually rely on manual intervention by the security administrator -><abstract>
to manually reset the passwords. Such manual steps result in -><abstract>
significant expense in large enterprises to deal with password -><abstract>
issues. Here we present a novel technique that uses a State Based -><abstract>
Authentication method to significantly increase the cost of brute- -><abstract>
force and dictionary attack on passwords. When deployed, it has -><abstract>
the potential to reduce the cost of password helpdesk significantly -><abstract>
by eliminating the need of most password-reset requests. -><abstract>
