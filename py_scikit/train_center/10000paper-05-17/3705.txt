Problem and Motivation: A designing of energy efficient -><abstract>
wireless sensor networks is one of the most trendy research -><abstract>
topics. In this paper the authors developed a new multi- -><abstract>
criteria approach which allows filtering out non-efficient -><abstract>
topologies during a phase of designing of a sensor network -><abstract>
and also running a self-adjustment process during its -><abstract>
functioning. It is shown that the problem of designing of an -><abstract>
energy efficient wireless sensor network belongs to the class -><abstract>
D of optimization combinatorial problems for which the -><abstract>
equivalent recognition problems are NP-complete or open. -><abstract>
The D-class (Peltsverger B., Khavronin O. (1999)) is such -><abstract>
that according to a decomposition approach there exist -><abstract>
particular criteria compatible with the main one, and the -><abstract>
recognition task corresponding to a particular criterion -><abstract>
always belongs to the P-class problem. -><abstract>
Decomposition approach allows constructing polynomial -><abstract>
approximate algorithms for the D-class problems. Indeed, to -><abstract>
determine a non-dominated point from a feasible set we -><abstract>
