3. APPROACH AND UNIQUENESS -><pubnum>
The top-level schematic of the visualization system is shown in -><abstract>
Figure 1. This project covers the visualization of the population -><abstract>
density dynamics component. The system uses population data -><abstract>
to generate the visualization in a format that makes it easy to -><abstract>
1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><abstract>
One major problem that faces the evacuation of cities attacked -><abstract>
with airborne biological and chemical agents is an effective -><abstract>
coordination and analysis of information from multiple sources. -><abstract>
Examples of relevant data resources include point of airborne agent -><abstract>
attack, wind speed and direction, population density and its -><abstract>
dynamics as time progresses, traffic pattern of roadways [1], and -><abstract>
topology of the affected city. This research is concerned with -><abstract>
developing an effective visualization system for the evacuation of -><abstract>
cities attacked with airborne biological and chemical agents. The -><abstract>
specific problem that this section of the project is aimed at solving -><abstract>
is informative data visualization on population distribution in -><abstract>
conjunction with other factors that will facilitate a successful -><abstract>
evacuation. -><abstract>
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK -><abstract>
Population distribution in a city is a necessary data that has many -><abstract>
applications [1]. One of such application is planning an -><abstract>
evacuation process in case of terrorist attacks and natural -><abstract>
disasters. The population density at various times of the day is -><abstract>
important. Thus, a population visualization system is essential to -><abstract>
planning evacuation in airborne biochemical attacks. -><abstract>
