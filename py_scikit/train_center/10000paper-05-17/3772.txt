1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><note>
The scheduling of batch process is a kind of NP-complete -><abstract>
problem and has been the interest of research for many years. -><abstract>
Various methods have been applied to solve such problems and -><abstract>
simulated annealing (SA) is the most efficient algorithm. But SA -><abstract>
is very slow when the problem size is large. In this work, particle -><abstract>
swarm optimization (PSO) was applied to solve the scheduling -><abstract>
problem of multiproduct batch process. The results show that PSO -><abstract>
is a powerful method for solving the batch process scheduling -><abstract>
problems and is superior to the widely used simulated annealing. -><abstract>
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK -><abstract>
Continuous operation and batch operation are two major types of -><abstract>
operations in chemical industry [1-3]. In batch operation, multiple -><abstract>
products are processed on a set processing units sequentially. How -><abstract>
to schedule the processing tasks according to the market demand -><abstract>
or other requirements is an important step in batch process system. -><abstract>
Usually this problem consists of determining the times and order -><abstract>
in which the products are to be produced in each processor given -><abstract>
the production facility in order to optimize an objective such as -><abstract>
