1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><note>
Clustering of servers is commonly employed for the purpose of -><abstract>
increasing availability, and performance of web sites. In general, -><affiliation>
the cluster consists of computers that are homogeneous in terms -><abstract>
of applications and hardware in order to facilitate scalability, fail- -><abstract>
over redundancy, and ease of load balancing. Typically, major -><abstract>
Internet service providers, and large corporations use such sys- -><abstract>
tems. On the other hand, educational institutions and small busi- -><abstract>
ness are faced with the task of providing various web-based ser- -><abstract>
vices on a small budget, and with limited resources. We describe -><abstract>
the design and implementation of an architecture that we devel- -><abstract>
oped for teaching web programming courses. The system is based -><abstract>
on a heterogeneous cluster of servers, providing an extensible -><abstract>
platform at a very reasonable cost. It is also suited for small busi- -><abstract>
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK -><abstract>
The second half of the nineties, and the beginning of this century -><abstract>
have seen considerable research in distributed computing, and -><abstract>
development of clustered servers. The ACM survey article [1] -><note>
