1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><pubnum>
This research is motivated by the insufficient tools for data -><abstract>
sharing and data integration in the relational database model. Data -><abstract>
integration requires a union of multiple queries to merge -><abstract>
semantically similar data from different sources. The eXtensible -><abstract>
Relational Database (XRDB) model [2] is a conceptual solution to -><abstract>
this problem and it introduces an extension to SQL, the eXtensible -><abstract>
Template Query Language (XTQL), to facilitate and automate -><abstract>
data sharing. -><abstract>
An XTQL query Q of degree one generates a set of union- -><abstract>
compatible queries based on the template query of Q. Given this -><abstract>
set of union-compatible queries, is it possible to rewrite these -><abstract>
queries into a better representation for the underlying relational -><abstract>
database management system (RDBMS) to execute? The goal of -><abstract>
this paper is to construct and investigate the usefulness of a -><abstract>
heuristic to rewrite a set of union-compatible queries generated by -><abstract>
an XTQL query of degree one. -><abstract>
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK -><abstract>
The standard query language for relational databases is the -><abstract>
Structured Query Language (SQL). When a SQL query is posed -><abstract>
to a RDBMS it is translated into a relational algebra expression -><abstract>
(RAE). Since relational algebra is a declarative language, the -><abstract>
RDBMS must generate an efficient execution strategy for the -><abstract>
RAE. In its raw, translated form, a RAE, in general, is inefficient -><abstract>
to compute. However, a reordering of the operations in a RAE can -><abstract>
provide useful optimizations. An outline of a general heuristic -><abstract>
optimization algorithm for RAEs can be found in [1, p. 611]. -><abstract>
The heuristic optimization of relational algebra expressions -><abstract>
(RAEs) is based on the preference of unary operations (i.e. -><abstract>
