1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><pubnum>
Designing normalized tables is a subject of great difficulty and -><note>
importance. Unnecessary redundancy may results not only in too -><abstract>
much space being used to store the data and poor query -><abstract>
performance, but it may also result in inconsistencies as -><abstract>
denormalized (unnecessary redundancy) data is much more -><abstract>
difficult to keep current. Converting tables from E-R Diagrams -><abstract>
(or extended E-R Diagrams or Class Diagrams) is a difficult task -><abstract>
for most students. Some students manage this task in their first -><abstract>
undergraduate class by simply memorizing the rules and never -><abstract>
knowing the reasons behind why the rule was created. Therefore -><abstract>
when they get to more advanced classes they had forgotten how to -><abstract>
accomplish the conversion because they never understood the -><abstract>
reasons behind the rules. -><abstract>
Developing an E-R Diagram from a Scenario is an even more -><abstract>
difficult task to master. The Kennesaw Database Courseware site -><abstract>
has many other topics such as SQL, Transactional SQL, -><abstract>
Concurrency, Recovery and Triggers. Our study involved -><abstract>
enhancing the Kennesaw Database Courseware site -><abstract>
(http://coffee.kennesaw.edu) with respect to the database design -><abstract>
portion of the site because it currently is the weakest sub-module. -><abstract>
The structure is too sequential, and the screens are cluttered and -><abstract>
show too much information at one time. The first two prototypes -><abstract>
will be: Physician Assigns Drug to Patient (ternary relationship), -><abstract>
and Vendor Supplies Product and Customer Places Order (two -><abstract>
binary relationship). The other redesigned exercises will be: -><abstract>
