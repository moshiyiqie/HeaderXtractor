1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><abstract>
Motivated by the increasing use of data warehouse systems and -><abstract>
the difficulties in its definition, we propose an automatic approach -><abstract>
for discovering multidimensional structure from relational -><abstract>
databases, based in MDA. MDA supports the development of -><abstract>
software- systems through the transformation of models [1]. MDA -><abstract>
requires that model transformations be defined precisely in terms -><abstract>
of the relationship between a source meta-model and a target -><abstract>
meta-model. This paper is concerned with OLAP schema -><abstract>
derivation (target meta-model) starting from the Relational meta- -><abstract>
model (source meta-model). For the definition and application of -><abstract>
model transformations we use the proposal for QVT presented in -><abstract>
[2]. -><abstract>
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK -><abstract>
An important condition for using a data warehouse is that data -><abstract>
warehouse schema follows a multidimensional paradigm. -><abstract>
Defining a multidimensional scheme is a hard task, demanding -><abstract>
knowledge of operational database schema. MDA consists of a set -><abstract>
of standards that allow the creation, implementation, evolution -><abstract>
and development of systems directed by models. The standards -><abstract>
that form MDA are: Unified Modeling Language (UML), Meta- -><abstract>
Object-Facility (MOF), XML Meta-Data Interchange (XMI) and -><abstract>
Common Warehouse Meta-model (CWM) [3]. Together, they -><abstract>
unify and simplify the modeling, design and the implementation -><abstract>
of systems. -><abstract>
CWM is a language created specifically to model database -><abstract>
applications. This meta-model has a set of class specifically for: -><abstract>
