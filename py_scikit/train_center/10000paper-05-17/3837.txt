PROBLEM AND MOVTIVATION -><affiliation>
The objective to this research is to give middle school students a -><abstract>
more incentive vision to use educational software by providing -><abstract>
software that is easy to learn and manipulate. This objective is -><abstract>
met by exploring visual programming techniques for novice -><abstract>
programmers. Even though recent studies have tried to test the -><abstract>
assumption that more computers in the classroom will allow -><abstract>
students greater usage of educational software, this assumption -><abstract>
has not been proven. This assumption forms the purpose of this -><abstract>
particular research, which focuses on developing a new structure -><abstract>
to encourage such usage of educational software in the -><abstract>
general science education by introducing them to basic -><abstract>
programming skills and visual programming techniques. -><abstract>
The software that is being created is a type of educational -><abstract>
simulation. An educational simulation is considered as a -><abstract>
computer-based activity that allows teachers to encourage -><abstract>
students in a learning activity such as exploratory learning. -><abstract>
There is limited usability in several software packages for -><abstract>
educational purposes, which have functionalities that are -><abstract>
unchangeable, restricted in changes, or too complex to change. -><abstract>
Yet others are usable, but are not affordable for most schools. -><abstract>
Also such packages do not achieve the goal of providing useful -><abstract>
classroom simulation technology that gives the teachers the -><abstract>
option of building simulations from scratch or reusing existing -><abstract>
simulations by adapting their functionality. These reasons give -><abstract>
the motivation for the exploration and investigation of the -><abstract>
