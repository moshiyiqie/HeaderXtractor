Event processing is defined as computing that performs -><abstract>
operations on event objects, including creating, reading, -><abstract>
transforming or deleting them. Complex Event Processing (CEP) -><abstract>
is a new way to deal with applications where lots of agents -><abstract>

These applications consist of massive amounts of data being -><abstract>
produced by the minute where traditional computing power -><abstract>
