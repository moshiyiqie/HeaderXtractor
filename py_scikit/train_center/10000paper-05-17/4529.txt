a lot of problems in raising crops and sustaining production. This -><abstract>
paper proposes a system that will automate the irrigation system, -><abstract>
especially in rural India, to compensate for the flimsy, inconsistent -><abstract>
and unreliable power supply system. Suggested design uses a Central -><abstract>

environmental parameters so as to assist it to work out the best array -><abstract>
of water pumps to be turned on at a given instance. Sensor devices -><abstract>
are kept at the vicinity of where the water pumps are so that -><abstract>
influential decision making parameters can be sensed and fed to the -><abstract>
intelligent software stationed at the central server. It uses mobile -><abstract>
technology to handshake between the central server and the sensor -><abstract>
controllers. Various derivatives of the same are discussed which need -><abstract>
to be weighed in terms of their practicality, ease of deployment and -><abstract>
of course the cost factor. It also helps the nation to preserve both -><abstract>
water and electricity by enforcing controlled but adequate usage of -><abstract>
