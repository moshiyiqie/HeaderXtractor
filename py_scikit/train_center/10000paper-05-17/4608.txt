1. BACKGROUND -><abstract>
Diversity, intent and aggregated search are three core retrieval -><abstract>
concepts that receive significant attention. In search result diversi- -><abstract>
fication one typically considers the relevance of a document in light -><abstract>
of other retrieved documents. The goal is to identify the probable -><abstract>
“aspects” of an ambiguous query, retrieve documents for each of -><abstract>
these aspects and make the search results more diverse. By doing -><abstract>
so, in the absence of any knowledge of users’ context or prefer- -><abstract>
ences, the chance that the user will find at least one of these results -><abstract>
to be relevant to their underlying information need is increased. -><abstract>
Those probable “aspects” of a query may refer to lexical ambigu- -><abstract>
ity (e.g., flash – Adobe Flash, flash light, flash gordon, flash air- -><abstract>
lines, flash mob, . . . ) or to intentional ambiguity (e.g., pizza – how -><abstract>
to make one, where to buy one, images, nutritional value, back- -><abstract>
ground, restaurant, . . . ). The automatic discovery of query intent -><abstract>
has become an active research area, with a range of observational -><abstract>
and algorithmic studies as outcomes. Understanding the likely in- -><abstract>
tents behind a query can help search engines to automatically route -><abstract>
the query to the corresponding vertical search engines so as to ob- -><abstract>
tain particularly relevant results, thus greatly improving user sat- -><abstract>
isfaction. In aggregated search the task is to search and assemble -><abstract>
information from a variety of sources and to organize the result- -><abstract>
ing material within a single interface. The result page of a mod- -><abstract>
ern search engine often goes beyond a simple ranked list. Many -><abstract>
specific intents are addressed by aggregated search solutions: spe- -><abstract>
cially presented documents, often retrieved from specific sources, -><abstract>
that stand out from the regular organic search results. -><abstract>
