Even highly autonomous agents must be told what -><abstract>
we want them to do. Ideally, we could communicate -><abstract>
our goals to agents by talking with them, rather than -><abstract>
encoding our goals in agent-specific knowledge repre- -><abstract>
sentations. This paper explores one problem that lies -><abstract>
in the way of this communicative ideal for robotic agents -><abstract>
- the acquisition and grounding of linguistic meaning. -><abstract>
How is it possible for a robot to identify and represent -><abstract>
features of the physical world, as mediated by its ability -><abstract>
to sense the world, that are relevant o understanding -><abstract>
natural anguage utterances? -><abstract>
This paper describes the results of an experiment -><abstract>
in which human subjects generated unrestricted natu- -><abstract>
ral language utterances to describe the activities of a -><abstract>
Pioneer-1 mobile robot. A combination of word clus- -><abstract>
tering applied to the utterances and a common subse- -><abstract>
quence algorithm applied to the time series of sensor -><abstract>
values recorded by the robot made it possible for the -><abstract>
Pioneer-1 to identify and represent a variety of features -><abstract>
of its environment to which the utterances referred. -><abstract>
One problem we face is that natural languages en- -><abstract>
code features of the world at various levels of abstrac- -><abstract>
tion. For example, consider the difference between ask- -><abstract>
ing a robot to push an object and asking a robot to -><abstract>
shove an object. The meanings of push and shove are -><abstract>
similar in that both involve contact between two enti- -><abstract>
ties and the application of force by one entity to the -><abstract>
