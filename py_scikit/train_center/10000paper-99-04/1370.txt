1. MOTIVATION -><abstract>
In retail industry as well as in many other industries supply -><abstract>
structures are evolving appearing more web-like than chain-like. -><abstract>
Such structures are called supply webs [9][11] - i.e. B2B-enabled -><abstract>
dynamic networks of supply chain units - and will replace today's -><abstract>
static supply chains to an increasing extent. -><abstract>
Partnerships between autonomous business entities in these -><abstract>
supply webs can be flexibly contracted or withdrawn and are -><abstract>
predominantly short-dated. This may cause complex coordination -><abstract>
problems since the resulting many-to-many interactions and -><abstract>
instantiated supply paths are not stable but change dynamically. -><abstract>
Each operative unit of a retail supply web can be modelled as an -><abstract>
agent [2] [3] which represents either a supplier, producer, broker, -><abstract>
wholesaler, retailer, warehouse, distribution center, branch, or -><abstract>
logistics service provider. -><abstract>
Flexible and efficient interactions between the supply web agents -><abstract>
can be enabled by the use of an agent-based supply web -><abstract>
coordination infrastructure that brings supply chain entities with -><abstract>
common or complementing goals together and enables them to -><abstract>
coordinate their activities. We propose to realize the supply web -><abstract>
agents as well as the components of the coordination -><abstract>
infrastructure as holonic agents [3] [10]. -><abstract>
2. HOLONIC MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS -><abstract>
A holonic agent [4] [5] [6] consists of a hierarchically structured -><abstract>
set of subagents from which each can consist of further subagents. -><abstract>
With agents, holonic agents share the properties of autonomy, -><abstract>
goal-directed behavior and communication. But the subagents -><abstract>
surrender parts of their autonomy to the upper hierarchy levels -><abstract>
within the holonic agent, e.g. the control over their local -><abstract>
resources. In this sense, one subagent of the holon, called head -><abstract>
