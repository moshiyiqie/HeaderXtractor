1. MOTIVATION -><abstract>
Multi-agent systems (MAS) are an integral part of current (D)AI -><abstract>
research. Their success and the success of agent technology is in the -><abstract>
majority of the literature ascribed to three major advantages, one of -><abstract>
which is that multi-agent systems are robust systems (cf. [1, 9]). -><abstract>
Although the literature treats robustness like an inherent feature of -><abstract>
MAS (which it is not), there is hardly any discussion on what -><abstract>
robustness actually means (a rare exception is the work of Kaminka -><abstract>
and Tambe [7] and Klein and Dellarocas [3]). Just like any other -><abstract>
artificial complex system, multi-agent systems need to be -><abstract>
specifically designed to be robust. Compared to conventional -><abstract>
computer science, the issue of robustness in MAS is different. Most -><abstract>
computer science systems are transformational systems, which -><abstract>
means they compute a function on some input. Here, techniques for -><abstract>
ensuring robustness exist (e.g. cf. [6]). However, the most -><abstract>
interesting multi-agent systems are open systems, which do not -><abstract>
explicitly compute a function (e.g. looking at the most predominant -><abstract>
example of an open system, namely the Internet, as computing a -><abstract>
function certainly misses the point). -><abstract>
2. ROBUSTNESS IN MAS -><abstract>
Robustness in multi-agent systems is more than introducing -><abstract>
redundancy. Redundancy will not solve problems such as malicious -><abstract>
agents in an open system, communication and information overload. -><abstract>
