close to 500 delegates, a wonderfully positive outcome in a year of major global upheaval, -><abstract>
and an affirmation of the importance of this conference series in the international computing -><abstract>

with a student as first named author. The 39 members of the Senior Program Committee had -><abstract>
recruited over 250 Program Committee members to handle the peer reviewing procedure and -><abstract>
during the process an additional 100 reviewers were enlisted. Each paper was refereed by -><abstract>
three independent reviewers, and after further input from the senior program committee -><abstract>
members and the Program Co-chairs, 142 submissions were selected as full papers and a -><abstract>
similar number of submissions were selected for poster presentation. The acceptance rate for -><abstract>
full papers was 24.6%, ensuring high quality and yet allowing diversity of topics and -><abstract>
perspectives. The acceptance rate for full papers and posters together was 49.7%, and -><abstract>
included representation from 28 countries. We sincerely thank the hardworking SPC and PC -><abstract>

This volume includes the full papers, poster summaries, details of the keynote presentations, -><abstract>
and also brief descriptions of selected demonstrations of agent technologies and agent- -><abstract>
related software and hardware. When taken together, we believe these articles and -><abstract>
summaries present a rich overview of a healthy international research activity in this key -><abstract>
field, and we hope that you will enjoy reading, or just browsing, these proceedings. -><abstract>
