Subdivision surfaces are smooth surfaces gener- -><abstract>
ated from polyhedral models. The three most popu- -><abstract>
lar subdivision methods (Modified Butterfly, Loop, -><abstract>
and )Catmull-Clark ) are compared in this project by -><abstract>
the smooth surfaces they generate from the same -><abstract>
initial meshes. Subdivision methods can be classi- -><abstract>
fied by 3 independent characteristics: their fidelity -><abstract>
to the data points (approximating vs. interpolat- -><abstract>
ing), type of input mesh (triangular vs. quadrilat- -><abstract>
eral), and type of refinement rule (vertex insertion -><abstract>
vs. corner-cutting). All 3 methods that we study use -><abstract>
vertex insertion. The Modified Butterfly scheme [2] -><abstract>
uses interpolation on a triangular mesh, the Loop -><abstract>
scheme [3] uses approximation on a triangular mesh, -><abstract>
and the Catmull-Clark scheme [1] uses approxima- -><abstract>
tion on a quadrilateral mesh. The different effect of -><abstract>
the three schemes comes from the different subdivi- -><abstract>
sion masks used (Fig. 1). -><abstract>
There are important differences between the -><abstract>
Loop and Modified Butterfly methods. As an ap- -><abstract>
proximating scheme, Loop subdivision will not pre- -><abstract>
serve the control points of the i-th level in the (i+l)- -><abstract>
st level. For this reason, models shrink during sub- -><abstract>
division (Fig. 1, column 2). This phenomenon is -><abstract>
particularly obvious in simple models like the cube -><abstract>
or tetrahedron. Complex models already have small -><abstract>
enough triangles that this shrinkage ffect is less no- -><abstract>
ticeable (Figs. 2-3). Modified Butterfly, on the other -><abstract>
hand, will keep all the original control points (as -><abstract>
