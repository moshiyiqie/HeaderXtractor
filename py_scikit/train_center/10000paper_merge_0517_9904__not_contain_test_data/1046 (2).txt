Students have indicated that the waditional method of lecturing was ineffectual, as they lost interest, slxuggled to pay -><abstract>
attention and attendance rates declined. The traditional method of teaching makes a presumption that the student has little to -><abstract>

of knowledge based systems and were inlroduced into the lecture format. -><abstract>
The puzzles were seen as having two initial benefits. The first benefit is an increase in the participation and interaction of the -><abstract>
students. Three to four puzzles are employed at various intervals throughout the lecture. The I~ -><abstract>
minmes in duration. According to Bligh [1] the imroduction of a period of change during the lecture (a period where either a -><abstract>
short break or a change in the teaching method occurs) can have a positive affect on the level of performance ofthe students -><abstract>
The second benefit is as a tool to create an environment ofproblem awareness. The puzzles used are a natural extension of -><abstract>
the learning process in knowledge based systems rather than an intrusion into it. The p-~les require admini~Uation fa level -><abstract>

Most of the subject's objectives are focused on students being able to build a system, namely, amethod, and the tools and -><abstract>
techniques of ISD. The remaining objective is applicable to many subjects: selecting criteria for; evaluating based on these -><abstract>
