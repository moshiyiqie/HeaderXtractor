In most introductory programm/n~, courses tasks, are given -><abstract>
to students to complete as a crucial part of their study. The -><abstract>

studems to apply their knowledge to new situations. -><abstract>
However, often the tasks have not been considered as a -><abstract>
vehicle that can direct learning behaviours in students. -><abstract>
This paper aims to encourage academics to start thinking -><abstract>
about the tasks they sot, in particular it explores -><abstract>
characteristics of progr~, ...... :n~ m~k.~ that affect student -><abstract>
