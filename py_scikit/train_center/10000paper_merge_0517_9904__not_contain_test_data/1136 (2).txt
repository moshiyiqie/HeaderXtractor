If robotic agents are to act autonomously they must -><abstract>
have the ability to construct and reason about models -><abstract>
of their physical environment. In all but the simplest, -><abstract>
static domains, such models must represent the dynam- -><abstract>
ics of environmental change. For example, because the -><abstract>
effects of actions are not instantaneous, planning to -><abstract>
achieve goals requires knowledge of how the robot's ac- -><abstract>
tions affect the state of the world over time. The tradi- -><abstract>
tional approach of hand-coding this knowledge is often -><abstract>
quite difficult, especially for robotic agents with rich -><abstract>
sensing abilities that exist in dynamic and uncertain -><abstract>
environments. Ideally, agents would acquire knowledge -><abstract>
of their environment autonomously, and then use this -><abstract>
knowledge to act autonomously. -><abstract>
This paper presents an unsupervised method for learn- -><abstract>
ing models of environmental dynamics based on clus- -><abstract>
tering multivariate time series. Experiments with a -><abstract>
Pioneer-1 mobile robot demonstrate the utility of the -><abstract>
method and show that the models acquired by the robot -><abstract>
correlate surprisingly well with human models of the en- -><abstract>
vironment. -><abstract>
Individual time series are obtained by recording the -><abstract>
output of a subset of an agent's ensors. We call these -><abstract>
time series experiences. An example of a sensor subset -><abstract>
on the Pioneer-1 robot is its array of seven sonars. Each -><abstract>
sonar returns the distance to the closest object in the -><abstract>
direction that it points. Recording of t -><abstract>
