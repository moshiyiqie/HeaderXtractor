1. MOTIVATION -><abstract>
In an open agent system the constituent agents are de- -><abstract>
veloped and owned by diﬀerent individuals or organisations -><abstract>
who may have conﬂicting interests. Hence the internals (i.e. -><abstract>
program and state) of agents are not public and so notions -><abstract>
of trust and deception are relevant. It is proposed that such -><abstract>
systems will be used in scenarios where legally binding con- -><abstract>
tracts are made and money is exchanged by the agents on -><abstract>
behalf of their owners. Not surprisingly, agent owners can -><abstract>
be expected to be reluctant to delegate tasks involving po- -><abstract>
tentially detrimental outcomes to an agent unless they can -><abstract>
be assured that the system has certain desirable properties. -><abstract>
It may be a requirement, for example, that an agent cannot -><abstract>
proﬁt from lying to its peers. Solutions from game theory -><abstract>
and economics [1] allow us to design mechanisms for interac- -><abstract>
tions (a set of public rules governing an interaction) which -><abstract>
provide incentives for participants to behave as we desire, -><abstract>
for example to tell the truth; mechanisms can be designed -><abstract>
to have properties such as individual rationality, incentive -><abstract>
compatibility and stability. Having chosen a suitable mech- -><abstract>
anism, we can implement it for an agent system as a protocol -><abstract>
and prove that these properties hold for the agent system. -><abstract>
