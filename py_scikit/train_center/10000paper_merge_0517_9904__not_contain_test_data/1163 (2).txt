An increasing number of agent-based systems now oper- -><abstract>
ate in complex dynamic environments, such as disaster res- -><abstract>
cue missions, enterprise integration, and education/training -><abstract>
environments. The proliferation of agents throughout these -><abstract>
domains will open up new opportunities for building large- -><abstract>
scale systems, but integrating agents into such large-scale -><abstract>
systems remains challenging. First, it is difficult for devel- -><abstract>
opers to locate relevant agents in distributed, open environ- -><abstract>
ments. Second, since the recruited agents do not usually -><abstract>
know how to work together, it -><abstract>
propriate inter-agent coordination. Third, the resulting inte- -><abstract>
grated system must be robust despite the uncertainties (e.g., -><abstract>
agent failures) of an open environment. -><abstract>
