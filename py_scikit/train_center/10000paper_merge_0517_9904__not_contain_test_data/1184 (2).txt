This work focuses on providing a multi-agent cooperation -><abstract>
infrastructure to support E-Commerce automation. Before -><abstract>
discussing our solutions, we first present atypical E-Commerce -><abstract>
scenario and the requirements for E-Commerce automation. -><abstract>
E-Commerce applications operate in a dynamic and -><abstract>
distributed environment, dealing with a large number of -><abstract>
heterogeneous information sources with evolving contents and -><affiliation>
dynamic availability. They typically rely on distributed and -><affiliation>
autonomous tasks for information search, fusion, extraction and -><abstract>
processing, without centralized control. -><abstract>
E-Commerce typically involves the following activities: -><abstract>
identifying requirements; brokering products; brokering -><abstract>
vendors; negotiating deals; or making purchase and payment -><abstract>
transactions. Today, these activities are initiated and executed -><abstract>
by humans. In the future, we see them being conducted by -><abstract>
software agents. -><abstract>
Software agents are personalized, continuously running and -><abstract>
semi-autonomous, driven by a set of beliefs, desires and -><abstract>
intentions (BDI). They can be used to mediate users and servers -><abstract>
to automate a number of the most time-consuming tasks in E- -><abstract>
Commerce, with enhanced parallelism. Agents can also be used -><abstract>
for business intelligence, such as discovering pattems (e.g. -><abstract>
shopping behavior patterns or service providing patterns) and -><abstract>
react to pattern changes. For example, suppose the sales of -><abstract>
VCRs had been strongly associated with the sales of TVs, but -><abstract>
this association has recently weakened as TV buyers turn to -><abstract>
