1. BACKGROUND -><abstract>
Historically, most virtual character research focuses on re- -><abstract>
alism, interaction with humans, and discourse. The majority -><abstract>
of the spatial positioning of characters has focused on one- -><abstract>
on-one conversations with humans or placing virtual charac- -><abstract>
ters side-by-side when talking. These rely on conversational -><abstract>
space as the main driver (if any) for character placement. -><abstract>
Robotics is more of a physical representation of characters -><abstract>
and by its nature relies on spatial positioning of objects. -><abstract>
Research in this area has involved providing directions to -><abstract>
robots or robots providing directions to humans. The main -><abstract>
concern is how to describe the spatial positioning of objects -><abstract>
with respect to other items in the environment [5, 16]. Some -><abstract>
robotics research has worked on incorporating robotics into -><abstract>
the theatre, but its purpose has been around pre-recording -><abstract>
humanistic movements for replaying in other scenarios [9]. -><abstract>
Psychologists have spent a lot of time digging into the -><abstract>
meanings behind key prepositions that describe spatial con- -><abstract>
cepts, such as in, on, near, and far [4, 7]. This is useful -><abstract>
in helping us to understand spatial instructions given by -><abstract>
