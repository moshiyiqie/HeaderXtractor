1. RESEARCH PROBLEM -><pubnum>
Our research is within the area of artificial intelligence and multi- -><abstract>
agent systems. More specifically, we focus on the robustness is- -><abstract>
sues [1] in reputation systems for electronic marketplaces and aim -><abstract>
to address the following problems, -><abstract>
• how to cope with dishonest advisors (buyers who provide -><abstract>
misleading opinions), improving the robustness of the trust -><abstract>
model. -><abstract>
• how to choose an appropriate seller to perform transaction by -><abstract>
querying advisors in an optimal way. -><abstract>
To explain, in multi-agent based e-marketplaces, self-interested -><abstract>
selling agents may act maliciously by not delivering products with -><abstract>
the same quality as promised. It is thus important for buying agents -><abstract>
to analyze their quality and determine which sellers to do business -><abstract>
with, based on their previous experience with the sellers. However, -><abstract>
realistically, in most e-marketplaces, buyers often encounter sellers -><abstract>
with which they have no previous experience. In such cases, they -><abstract>
can query other buyers (called advisors) about the sellers. But, ad- -><abstract>
visors may act dishonestly by providing misleading opinions (un- -><abstract>
fair ratings) to promote low quality sellers or demote sellers with -><abstract>
high quality. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the quality of advi- -><abstract>
sors’ opinions to determine their reliability. -><abstract>
While it is prima facie necessary to gather opinions about a seller, -><abstract>
a buyer may not need to query all the advisors about the seller, since -><abstract>
the cost of querying all the advisors may be greater than the value -><abstract>
derived from a successful transaction with the seller. Thereby, it is -><abstract>
necessary to design an optimal scheme to selectively query advi- -><abstract>
sors and choose a quality seller to perform transaction, in order to -><abstract>
