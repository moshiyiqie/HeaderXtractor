1. CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES -><note>
This paper describes an architecture to build and execute -><abstract>
multimedia adaptive services, like information retrieval/filtering, -><abstract>
meeting management or distance learning. The environment is -><abstract>
composed of heterogeneous agents, resources and communication -><abstract>
media. Service building tools are often static, with an interactivity -><abstract>
bounded at design time and various research works already shown -><abstract>
new ways to a better interaction, like OAA [4] or KIMSAC [1]. -><abstract>
Here, humans are considered as agents of the system and services -><abstract>
are viewed as frames that guide a multi-agent cooperation. The -><abstract>
objective is to monitor interactions in order to avoid problems as -><abstract>
soon as possible and to optimize the service quality, depending on -><abstract>
the available resources. -><affiliation>
