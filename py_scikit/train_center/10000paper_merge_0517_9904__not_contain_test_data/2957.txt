Massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) have become extremely popular among network gamers. Despite -><abstract>
their success, one of MMORPG’s greatest challenges is the increasing use of game bots, that is, autoplaying game clients. The use of -><abstract>
game bots is considered unsportsmanlike and is therefore forbidden. To keep games in order, game police, played by actual human -><abstract>
players, often patrol game zones and question suspicious players. This practice, however, is labor-intensive and ineﬀective. To -><abstract>
address this problem, we analyze the traﬃc generated by human players versus game bots and propose general solutions to identify -><abstract>
game bots. Taking Ragnarok Online as our subject, we study the traﬃc generated by human players and game bots. We find that -><abstract>
their traﬃc is distinguishable by 1) the regularity in the release time of client commands, 2) the trend and magnitude of traﬃc -><abstract>
burstiness in multiple time scales, and 3) the sensitivity to diﬀerent network conditions. Based on these findings, we propose -><abstract>
four strategies and two ensemble schemes to identify bots. Finally, we discuss the robustness of the proposed methods against -><abstract>
countermeasures of bot developers, and consider a number of possible ways to manage the increasingly serious bot problem. -><abstract>
