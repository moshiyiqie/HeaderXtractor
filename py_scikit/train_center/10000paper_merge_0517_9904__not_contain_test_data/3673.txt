1. PROBLEM & MOTIVATION -><pubnum>
TCP Reno, the most widely used implementation on the Internet, -><abstract>
uses retransmission timeouts and the receipt of three duplicate -><abstract>
ACKs to detect packet loss in the network. In case of multiple -><abstract>
congested links, it is important to detect packet losses as early as -><abstract>
possible in order to prevent unnecessary timeouts and retransmits. -><abstract>
Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes seek to improve the -><abstract>
overall user response time by using queue build-ups at the routers -><abstract>
to detect congestion. Previous research has focused on -><abstract>
determining the effects of AQM schemes on HTTP/1.0 traffic in -><abstract>
single congested link networks [2]. In this experiment, we -><abstract>
evaluated the performance of TCP Reno with drop-tail routers and -><abstract>
ECN-enabled TCP with Selective Acknowledgements (SACK) [5] -><abstract>
over Adaptive Random Early Detection (ARED) [4] routers in a -><abstract>
multiple congested link network. -><abstract>
2. BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK -><abstract>
There are two main approaches to congestion detection in a -><abstract>
computer network: end-to-end methods and router-assisted -><abstract>
methods. In end-to-end methods, network congestion is detected -><abstract>
by the end systems, usually through packet drops or the receipt of -><abstract>
three duplicate acknowledgements (ACKs). The intermediate -><abstract>
routers in the network play no explicit role in detecting -><abstract>
congestion. TCP Reno uses this form of congestion detection. -><abstract>
Router-assisted schemes, on the other hand, use the effects of -><abstract>
congestion, such as increased queues at the routers, to detect -><abstract>
congestion in the network. AQM schemes, e.g. ARED, usually try -><abstract>
