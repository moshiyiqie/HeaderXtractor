1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><pubnum>
There are different patterns for organizing domain logic in -><abstract>
enterprise applications. Good design patterns give recurring -><abstract>
solutions to software design problems in real-world application -><abstract>
development [1]. This presentation will describe the domain -><abstract>
model for an enterprise system, net-centric performance -><abstract>
improvement (Net-PI), which assists organizations in the analysis, -><abstract>
support and evaluation of human performance [2]. The system has -><abstract>
gone through a number of iterations and is based on Microsoft -><abstract>
.NET and SQL Server 2000. The current architecture of Net-PI is -><abstract>
based on the domain model created by Neo (.NET Entity Objects) -><abstract>
which produces an object-relational mapping layer with -><abstract>
extensible base-classes to access data on relational databases. The -><abstract>
architecture incorporates the object data and its behavior -><abstract>
(business logic and events) into classes which contain transparent -><abstract>
database interaction. It is excellent in dealing with complexity and -><abstract>
maintainability. -><abstract>
