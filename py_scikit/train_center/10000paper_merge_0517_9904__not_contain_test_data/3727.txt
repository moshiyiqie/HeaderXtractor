Visualization of scalar and vector fields in the immersive -><abstract>
very important for its application to radiation shielding research at -><abstract>
NASA Langley Research Center. In particular, a system was -><abstract>
study of south Atlantic anomaly, and for the visualization of -><abstract>
geomagnetically trapped protons and electrons in the surrounding -><abstract>
space to earth. -><abstract>
Background and Related Work -><note>
During my sabbatical at NASA Langley Research Center for fall -><abstract>
of 2004, I have done research and developed a complete -><abstract>
methodology and the underlying software for the purpose of -><abstract>
visualizing scalar and vector fields for various purposes as stated -><abstract>
above. -><abstract>
Approach and Uniqueness -><abstract>
Using the technique I have developed, a vector field can be -><abstract>
visualized in two modes: -><abstract>
In mode one, the directional curved lines can be visualized -><abstract>
(Fig.1.) in the surrounding 3-D space to any source(s) of a vector -><abstract>
field. The size of the surrounding spherical space for visualization -><abstract>
of the directional curved line flux as well as the scale for this -><abstract>
visualization can be continually varied using the CAVE input -><abstract>
wand. -><abstract>
In mode two, the vector field at regularly spaced points on the -><abstract>
surface of a surrounding sphere to sources of the vector field is -><abstract>
represented correctly through the length and direction of the -><abstract>
depicted vectors at these points (Fig.2.). As in mode one, the -><abstract>
