1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><intro>
Recall of new information is the basis for reading comprehension -><abstract>
and is a fundamental skill that affects virtually every area of -><abstract>
human activity in which information is displayed. Because the -><abstract>
computer has become the primary means by which information is -><abstract>
disseminated, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) factors play an -><abstract>
important role in the effectiveness of the process. This paper -><abstract>
describes the results of an experiment conducted to study the -><abstract>
effect of color and repetition on the comprehension of information -><abstract>
displayed by way of a computer monitor. -><abstract>
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK -><abstract>
The use of color in media has long been used to capture attention -><abstract>
or emphasize a message, especially in advertising. Previous -><abstract>
studies have indicated that ads in which colored words were used -><abstract>
were viewed more frequently [1]. The results further indicated -><abstract>
that the most effective ads were those whose printed claims of -><abstract>
quality or superiority were highlighted with color. Research has -><abstract>
also been reported on the effects of character position, -><abstract>
background color, text style, and text color on ergonomic, HCI -><abstract>
factors [4]. -><abstract>
