ABSTRACT -><abstract>
Many networking researches depend on an accurate simulation of -><abstract>
network traffic. For example, Intrusion Detection Systems -><abstract>
generally require tuning to be effective in each new environment. -><abstract>
It follows that researchers need to produce traffic backgrounds for -><abstract>
laboratory testing that accurately reflect the characteristics of -><affiliation>
organizations of interest. Because self-similarity is a common -><abstract>
the same degree of self-similarity as the original traffic are desired. -><abstract>
The authors discovered that modeling some important protocol -><abstract>
characteristics has required the use of hybrid modeling and -><abstract>
heavy-tailed distributions. These include protocols like HTTP that -><abstract>
account for a large percentage of traffic today although they were -><abstract>
not present for studies done a few years ago. In this paper hybrid -><abstract>
and heavy-tailed modeling techniques are used to build detailed -><abstract>
models of major Internet protocols. NS-2 is used to simulate the -><abstract>
Internet traffic captured at University of Central Florida and the -><abstract>
result is compared against original traffic. -><abstract>
