PROBLEM & MOTIVATION -><affiliation>
Since classical cryptography relies on difficulty and -><abstract>
infeasibility of computation to find the plain text, the -><abstract>
cryptography is losing security more and more as -><abstract>
computational power is increased by technical innovations. -><abstract>
Therefore, unconditionally secure cryptography has been -><abstract>
expected. In this paper, we propose a novel, secure, no- -><abstract>
key, protocol: Quantum Three-Pass Protocol (QTPP). In -><abstract>
this protocol, quantum superposition states are used for -><abstract>
transmission instead of classical signals in classical -><abstract>
cryptography. -><abstract>
BACKGROUND & RELATED LITERATURE -><abstract>
There is a way to deliver a message in a box securely -><abstract>
to a receiver using two padlocks without sharing keys to -><abstract>
open the locks. First, Alice (a sender) locks the box with -><abstract>
her padlock and sends the box to Bob (a receiver). Bob -><abstract>
receives the box and locks the box with his padlock and -><abstract>
sends the box to Alice. At this point, the box has two -><abstract>
padlocks. Then, Alice takes off her padlock from the box -><abstract>
and sends it again to Bob. Bob removes his padlock from -><abstract>
the box. Bob got the message securely from Alice. If we -><abstract>
use this idea in cryptography, the algorithm establishes -><abstract>
secure communication with no-key-exchange in advance. -><abstract>
published but introduced by Massey [1]) that has never -><abstract>
been proved [2]. The problem of this three-pass protocol -><abstract>
comes from the fact that an eavesdropper can make copies -><abstract>
of the transmitted messages. -><abstract>
We utilize quantum phenomena to circumvent the -><abstract>
