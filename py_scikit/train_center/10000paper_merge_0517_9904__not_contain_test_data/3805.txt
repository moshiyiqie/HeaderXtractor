1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><pubnum>
Most conventional databases in use today are based on the -><abstract>
relational model. Values in a relation are taken from a finite set of -><abstract>
strictly typed domain values. Each relation in the database -><abstract>
represents a proposition and each record in a relation is a -><abstract>
[3], [5]). It could be argued, however, that this required precision -><abstract>
actually gives an insufficient representation of the world. The -><abstract>
model is grounded in binary black-and-white but much of reality -><abstract>
actually exists in shades of gray. As such, the conventional -><abstract>
relational database model has limited usefulness. -><abstract>
One area that illustrates this limitation is in the everyday, -><abstract>
subjective language generally used to describe people. For -><abstract>
difficult to represent under the conventional relational model both -><abstract>
because it uses descriptive words that are inherently imprecise, -><abstract>
and also because differing communities (i.e., groups with internal -><abstract>
agreement on subjective meanings of these terms) may describe -><abstract>
the same person differently. The purpose of this research project -><abstract>
was to implement a relational database that represented images -><abstract>
with imprecise attributes and that, by incorporating user feedback, -><abstract>
would adapt the descriptions of the attributes so that the database -><abstract>
appropriately represented the consensus of a particular user -><abstract>
community. -><abstract>
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK -><abstract>
The traditional relational database model is based on precise -><abstract>
values. The concept of fuzziness as seminally described by Zadeh -><abstract>
[7], however, includes imprecision, uncertainty, and degrees of -><keyword>
