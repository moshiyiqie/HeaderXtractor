1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><note>
Since the birth of computer science some 40 years ago, -><abstract>
educators and researchers alike have struggled with -><abstract>
improving student success, particularly in the introductory -><abstract>
programming courses, which often have a very high failure -><abstract>
rate. Although many researchers have studied how and -><abstract>
why students succeed in programming courses, no research -><abstract>
to date has analyzed multiple variables simultaneously to -><abstract>
develop an integrated model of student success. Rather, the -><abstract>
research has been fragmented and non-cumulative, with -><abstract>
researchers studying hundreds of different variables, under -><abstract>
different conditions, and reaching different conclusions. -><abstract>
Educators are faced with the arduous task of developing -><abstract>
interventions and pedagogical techniques based on a -><abstract>
plethora of seemingly important variables. In this work, we -><abstract>
begin to bring together previous research to develop a -><abstract>
model of student success based on theoretical reasoning. -><abstract>
