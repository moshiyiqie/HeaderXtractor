PROBLEM & MOTIVATION -><note>
Scientist and engineers with the National Aeronautics and Space -><abstract>
Administration (NASA) deal with hundreds of thousands of -><abstract>
technical standards from hundreds of technical organizations. -><abstract>
With such a large scale of technical knowledge available, it can -><abstract>
be difficult for the individual scientist or engineer to know they -><abstract>
are examining the most current and relevant information and what -><abstract>
related knowledge is available. A mechanism is needed to assist -><abstract>
in answering the following type of questions: -><abstract>
related to this standard? -><abstract>
The relationship between standards, training material and lessons -><abstract>
learned, as depicted in Figure 1, is a valuable source of long-term -><abstract>
institutional knowledge [1]. -><abstract>
A lot of work has been done on document search [2, 3], this -><abstract>
previous work exploits matching strategies to address the issue of -><abstract>
locating similar documents. These approaches are generally based -><abstract>
on the frequency of single words across the document corpus. -><abstract>
These single words may be user supplied keywords or generated -><keyword>
by indexing the document of interest. Experience has shown that -><degree>
only searching for the documents by single indexed word -><degree>
degrades the efficiency and precision of the searching pace once -><degree>
