1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><abstract>
Requirement analysis is an integral part of the software -><abstract>
engineering process. Usually, the information to be modeled is -><abstract>
relatively unbounded and lacks structure. This makes it difficult -><abstract>
to obtain a consensus on the requirement analysis document. This -><abstract>
paper provides an examination of how both requirement analysis -><abstract>
and knowledge elicitation can be made more efficient in the -><abstract>
Internet age by making it an open process. In particular it -><abstract>
describes how the World Wide Web can be used to facilitate -><abstract>
collaborative development and reuse of requirements. The various -><affiliation>
issues faced by present day requirements engineers in creating a -><abstract>
requirement analysis document and eliciting knowledge from -><abstract>
experts, specifically in the domain of medical expert systems is -><abstract>
dealt with. -><abstract>
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK -><abstract>
Identifying the needs of the client by means of requirement -><abstract>
analysis is fundamental in the software engineering cycle. The -><abstract>
requirement analysis document serves as an agreement between -><abstract>
clients and developers [1]. As noted by several researchers, -><abstract>
requirement analysis and knowledge elicitation have common -><abstract>
goals in the sense that they both aim at gathering relevant -><abstract>
information and modeling it in a form suitable for implementation -><abstract>
[1] [2]. Particularly, in the case of expert systems, the knowledge -><abstract>
base also details the rationale to be followed while developing the -><abstract>
system. As a case study, reference will be made to a project that -><abstract>
aims at designing a medical diagnostic system. This system will -><abstract>
diagnose and prescribe treatments for a particular infection based -><abstract>
