1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><pubnum>
This poster will present recent enhancements to the Animated -><abstract>
Database Courseware (ADbC), formerly called KDC, to help -><abstract>
students understand the fundamentals of database concepts and -><abstract>
technologies. The software has gone through a major re-structure -><abstract>
of the menu system with the redesign of many modules, and the -><abstract>
addition of additional modules as well as the planning for -><abstract>
modules based on advanced concepts. As it is difficult to -><abstract>
communicate breadth and depth of concepts in a single database -><abstract>
course, these animations are intended to support more in-depth -><abstract>
student learning. The animations were developed to complement -><abstract>
(not substitute for) introductory database textbook or DBMS -><abstract>
products. The software is independent of any book or software -><abstract>
and is designed to be fairly intuitive with a very low learning -><abstract>
curve for faculty. Furthermore, the software is available at no cost -><note>
at and has been made freely available at http://adbc.kennesaw.edu. -><affiliation>
The work is the result of an NSF funded project (#0717707). -><affiliation>
