1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><affiliation>
The Animated Database Courseware (http://adbc.kennesaw.edu) -><web>
that will be presented consists of animations, examples, and -><abstract>
sample tests to support database curricula. It consists of four -><abstract>
major models (Database Design, SQL, Transactional Processing, -><abstract>
and Advanced Concepts) as well as many sub-modules. This -><abstract>
software has been used extensively at Kennesaw State University -><affiliation>
as well as many other universities throughout the country. -><affiliation>
Evaluations have indicated that it improves learning depth and -><abstract>
breadth. However, students still commit some classical -><abstract>
misconceptions. This work describes a new sub-module to address -><abstract>
misconceptions and has recently been implemented in our -><abstract>
courseware: SQL Misconceptions. This work has been funded by -><note>
NSF grant # 0717707. -><note>
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED -><note>
LITERATURE -><note>
Work on the software animations involves doing research in one -><note>
or more of the following areas: Database, Programming (Java or -><note>
Flash), Visual Design and Pedagogy. -><note>
For this particular model, it involved studying SQL and Relational -><note>
Algebra [1-5]. The developing environment of the misconceptions -><note>
