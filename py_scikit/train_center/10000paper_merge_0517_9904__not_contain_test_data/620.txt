This article introduces a novel approach to the -><abstract>

take a fixed set of goals, initial state, and a domain -><abstract>
theory - and adapts them to support the incremental, -><abstract>
hierarchical and exploratory nature of collaborative -><affiliation>
planning that occurs between human planners, and that -><abstract>
multi-agent planning systems attempt to support. This -><abstract>
approach is planner-independent - in that it could be -><abstract>
applied to any classical planning technique - and recasts -><abstract>
the problem of collaborative planning as a search -><affiliation>
through a space of possible inputs to a classical plan- -><abstract>
