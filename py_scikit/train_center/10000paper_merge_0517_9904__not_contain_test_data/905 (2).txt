classification is the first step for Web search service con- -><abstract>

Web documents by using a height-three modified deci- -><abstract>
sion tree which splits the root, depth-one nodes, and -><abstract>
depth-two nodes based on keywords, descriptions, and -><abstract>
hyperlinks, respectively. A classification starts with a -><abstract>
Web page at the root of the decision tree and traces -><abstract>
paths downward to leaves, which give the categories of -><abstract>

1 Introduct -><abstract>
The Web is a hyper-multimedia body of approximately -><abstract>
900 million pages that continues to grow at roughly a -><abstract>
million pages per day [4]. Also, the Web pages lack a -><abstract>
unifying structure and show far more authoring styles -><abstract>
and content variation than that seen in traditional -><abstract>
text-document collections. The Web's growing size -><abstract>
and lack of structure put the Web search services in a -><abstract>
difficult position. Current search services can be divided -><abstract>
into search engines and directories, which classify -><abstract>
Web pages according to the submission of Web page -><note>
descriptions from Webmasters or Web reviewers. This -><note>
