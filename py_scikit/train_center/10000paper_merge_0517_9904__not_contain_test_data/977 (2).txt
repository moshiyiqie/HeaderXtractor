ABSTRACT -><abstract>
We discuss our research into the development and testing of a -><abstract>
notification system claims library for assisting designers in -><abstract>
interface development. Our research focuses on achieving -><abstract>
consistent values among multiple users when adding and -><abstract>
searching claims. We discuss the methods used for redesigning -><abstract>
the application, techniques used for testing, and reengineering -><abstract>
goals for the Claims Library. This work extends previous efforts -><abstract>
on design knowledge reuse in the HCI research community, as -><abstract>
such our methods and techniques should be reusable by others. -><abstract>
We designed the interface to the library for users entering claims, -><abstract>
ensuring usability and understandability. Since we noted -><abstract>
problems with a particular feature (the IRC input method) through -><abstract>
an internal round of testing, we conducted a lab-based test to -><abstract>
isolate specific breakdowns. Our results validated portions of -><abstract>
claim classification indices, suggest key reengineering changes -><abstract>
that should inform ongoing and future development of the claims -><abstract>
