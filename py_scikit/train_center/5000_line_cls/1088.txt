ABSTRACT -><abstract>
Models of human behaviours used in multi-agent simulations are -><abstract>
limited by the ability of introspection of the social actors: some of -><abstract>
their knowledge (reflexes, habits, non-formalized expertise) -><abstract>
cannot be extracted through interviews. In this paper, we propose -><abstract>
an artificial maieutic approach to extract such pieces of -><abstract>
knowledge, by helping the actors to better understand, and -><abstract>
sometimes formulate, their own behaviours. We present here the -><abstract>
first results using two complementary works in social simulations, -><abstract>
one in the domain of air traffic control and one in the domain of -><abstract>
common-pool resources sharing. -><abstract>
