1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION -><pubnum>
One of the key requirements in collaborating distributed appli- -><affiliation>
cations is that their sub-systems remain synchronized during their -><abstract>
joint operation. There is an increasing need to be able to respond -><abstract>
to failures that occur in their synchronization and coordinated op- -><abstract>
eration, in particular to be able to diagnose the causes for synchro- -><abstract>
nization failures that may occur. -><abstract>
We choose to use a model-based diagnosis approach (MBD) [1] -><abstract>
that relies on a model of the diagnosed system, which is utilized to -><abstract>
simulate the behavior of the system given the operational context -><abstract>
(typically, the systemâ€™s inputs). The resulting simulated behavior -><abstract>
(typically, outputs) are compared to the actual behavior to detect -><abstract>
discrepancies indicating failures. The model can then be used to -><abstract>
pinpoint possible failing components within the system. MBD is -><abstract>
increasingly being applied in distributed and multi-agent systems. -><abstract>
While successfully addressing key challenges, MBD has been dif- -><abstract>
ficult to apply to diagnosing coordination failures. This is because -><abstract>
many such failures take place at the boundaries between the agent -><abstract>
and their environment, including other agents. -><abstract>
For instance, in a team, an agent may send a message that an- -><abstract>
other agent, due to a broken radio, did not receive. As a result, the -><abstract>
two agents come to disagree on an action to be taken. Lacking an -><abstract>
omniscient diagnoser that knows of the sending of the message, the -><abstract>
receiver has no way to detect and diagnose its fault. Surprisingly, it -><abstract>
is still often possible to detect and diagnose coordination failures, -><abstract>
given the actions of agents, and the coordination constraints that -><abstract>
should ideally hold between them. In the example above, knowing -><abstract>
that the two agents should be in agreement as to their actions, and -><abstract>
