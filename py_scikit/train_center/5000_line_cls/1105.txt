The task of hard-coding agent behaviors to achieve desired team -><abstract>
behaviors is very difficult, if not intractable. The complexity of -><abstract>
multiagent problems can also rise exponentially with the number of -><abstract>
agents and their behavioral sophistication. The field of cooperative -><abstract>
multiagent learning promises solutions to these issues by employ- -><abstract>
ing automatic search methods to discover agent behaviors, and as -><abstract>
such it has been the focus of numerous studies in recent years. -><abstract>
Research in cooperative multiagent learning usually concentrates -><abstract>
on two opposite approaches, each generating a different range of -><abstract>
questions. First, there are techniques to learn homogeneous be- -><abstract>
haviors for large swarms of identical agents; they assume all agents -><abstract>
have identical behavior (a significant reduction to the search space), -><abstract>
but the potential of specialization to different tasks is minimized. -><abstract>
Second, there are techniques that allow each agent to specialize to -><abstract>
a unique behavior, thus creating a wide range of potential solutions; -><abstract>
these methods are however applicable to only small teams due to -><abstract>
the increased complexity that comes with larger numbers of agents. -><abstract>
My interests target the middle-ground, namely moderately large -><abstract>
teams of agents with heterogeneous behaviors. Combining the -><abstract>
desideratum for scalability of learning to larger teams with the need -><abstract>
for agent specialization is not an easy task; one solution is to de- -><abstract>
compose the team into multiple groups, where all agents within a -><abstract>
group have identical behavior (1; 2; 3). Current approaches only al- -><abstract>
