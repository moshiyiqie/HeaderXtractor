Migration is the ability of an agent to transfer from one -><abstract>
embodiment, for example a robot, to another such as a mobile -><abstract>
phone. For agents that are to act as personal companions -><abstract>
migration is desirable as access to different capabilities can -><abstract>
provide more constant companionship to a user. This interactive -><abstract>
demonstration of screen to phone migration illustrates one -><abstract>
application of the open-source architecture developed on the -><abstract>
LIREC project to support migration of an affective agent across -><abstract>
many types of embodiment. -><abstract>
