Coordinating a mobile sensing agents (MST) to adequately -><abstract>
position themselves with regards to points of interest gener- -><abstract>
ally called targets (e.g., disaster survivors, military targets, -><abstract>
or pollution spills), is a challenging problem in many mul- -><abstract>
tiagent applications. Such applications are inherently dy- -><abstract>
namic due to changes in the environment, technology fail- -><abstract>
ures, and incomplete knowledge of the agents. Agents must -><abstract>
adaptively respond by changing their locations to continu- -><abstract>
ally optimize the coverage of targets. Optimally choosing -><abstract>
where to position agents to meet the coverage requirements -><abstract>
in a static setting is a known NP-hard optimization prob- -><abstract>
lem. Doing so in a dynamic distributed environment is a -><abstract>
challenging task. In this work I continue to develop and -><abstract>
study the DCOP MST model [2] which is a new model for -><abstract>
representing MST problems that is based on the Distributed -><abstract>
Constraint Optimization (DCOP) Framework. -><abstract>
DCOP is a general model of distributed multi-agent coor- -><abstract>
dination. A DCOP is constituted of agents, variables, and -><abstract>
(soft and hard) constraints between sets of variables that -><abstract>
reflect the costs of assignments to the variables. Each agent -><abstract>
has exclusive control over a subset of the variables and knows -><abstract>
information relevant to its variables, such as the values that -><abstract>
can be assigned to them (their domains) and the constraints -><abstract>
involving them. The goal is to select an assignment of val- -><abstract>
ues to the variables that minimizes the aggregated costs of -><abstract>
the constraints. In many ways DCOPs are a natural fit for -><abstract>
