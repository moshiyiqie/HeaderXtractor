PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><affiliation>
The crux of the problem is the interference in -><abstract>
Broadband fixed wireless networks. The number -><abstract>
of wireless channels is usually limited and the -><abstract>
channels are reused. Reusing channels causes -><abstract>
co-channel and adjacent channel interference, -><abstract>
which will degrade the Signal to Noise Ratio of -><abstract>
received packets and the throughput of a -><abstract>
Broadband fixed wireless network. Recently, -><abstract>
stochastic and machine learning models were -><abstract>
used to reduce or eliminate the interference -><abstract>
between the channels. Recent research [1-7] -><abstract>
encourages that genetic algorithms can be used -><abstract>
in channel allocation and interference avoidance. -><abstract>
In this research, we used a simple genetic -><abstract>
algorithm for selection of the best channel -><abstract>
among the free and available channels at a given -><affiliation>
access point. -><affiliation>
BACKGROUND AND RELATED -><abstract>
WORK -><abstract>
Wireless cellular networks are bandwidth and -><abstract>
power limited. A finite frequency spectrum is -><abstract>
available for provision of commercial services. -><affiliation>
Based on the service requirements, the allocated -><abstract>
spectrum is divided into a number of channels. -><abstract>
