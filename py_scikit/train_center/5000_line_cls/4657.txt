Problem and Motivation: -><note>
The wide-spread connectivity provided by Internet and an -><abstract>
increasing use of computers have led to the rapid propagation of -><abstract>
malicious mobile codes like viruses and worms. Worm programs -><abstract>
have never stopped their attacking since Morris worm was found -><abstract>
in 1988 [2]. Famous ones include Code Red and Nimda in 2001, -><abstract>
SQL Slammer, Blaster and Welchia in 2003, Netsky and Sasser in -><abstract>
2004. The computer worms disrupt tens of thousands of -><abstract>
businesses and homes worldwide, and cause millions of dollars of -><abstract>
loss in the society [5]. In this paper, we propose a control system -><abstract>
to automatically detect such malicious code and mitigate its -><abstract>
propagation at the early infection stage. -><abstract>
Background and Related Work: -><abstract>
As we know, when a machine is online, the network connection is -><abstract>
generally localized and the connection rate is stable at certain -><abstract>
level [1]. On the contrary, a worm program always tries to open as -><abstract>
many connections as possible in order to propagate as fast as -><abstract>
possible. This observation has been supported by evidence from -><abstract>
[3] and [4]. Based on this observation, Williamson [1] provides a -><abstract>
host-based throttling algorithm that could limit the spread of -><abstract>
machines. Wong et al. [5] analyze the efficiency of different -><abstract>
deployment strategies of the rate limiting mechanism using -><abstract>
mathematical epidemic propagation models. We propose to build -><abstract>
a control system that could detect worm propagation by using -><abstract>
statistical process control techniques. The control system learns -><abstract>
from the past data, and then identifies the possible worm -><abstract>
propagation during the monitoring period. -><abstract>
The use of statistical method in process control began at the Bell -><abstract>
