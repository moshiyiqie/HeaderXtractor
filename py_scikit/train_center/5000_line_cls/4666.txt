1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION -><pubnum>
Computerized documents are created using a wide variety of -><abstract>
software and exist in a wide variety of formats, which usually -><abstract>
causes difficulties for any application system which is intended to -><abstract>
process documents after their initial creation. Extracting text data -><abstract>
from files in various file formats and placing it in a designated -><abstract>
template file for further processing enables companies to manage -><abstract>
documents more efficiently and effectively. The current -><abstract>
ASCII text and database files. The main goal of this project is to -><abstract>
develop a system suitable for installation on end-user machines -><abstract>
which will hook in to the Windows XP print processing system -><abstract>
and extract data from the print data stream which are stored in the -><abstract>
spool directory. The software will then allow the user to view the -><abstract>
pages as they will appear on the printer and select the portions of -><abstract>
further processing such as insertion of additional text and -><abstract>
barcodes into the file and post-verification of the data. -><abstract>
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK -><abstract>
PostScript [1] is a programming language for drawing text and -><abstract>
graphics in a device independent manner. This device -><abstract>
independence means that the image is described without reference -><abstract>
to any specific device features such as printer resolution, so that -><abstract>
the same description could be used on any PostScript printer -><abstract>
