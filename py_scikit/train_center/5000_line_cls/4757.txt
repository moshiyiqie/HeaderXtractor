1. MOTIVATION -><abstract>
Cluster Computing is becoming cost effective and popular for its -><affiliation>
enormous computational power. High availability features need to -><affiliation>
be included to ensure that cluster computing environments can -><abstract>
provide continuous services. A typical availability modeling -><affiliation>
method is based on the analytical formalisms such as fault tree, -><abstract>
Markov chains, Stochastic Petri Net (SPN), etc. However, people -><abstract>
in system design and development may not be familiar with the -><abstract>
analytical modeling techniques. This inevitably creates a gap -><abstract>
between system designers and reliability engineers. Moreover, the -><abstract>
analytical models are still primitive. As a consequence, Markov -><abstract>
chain and Petri Net models are often large when the modeled -><abstract>
systems are complicated. These large models may be out of the -><abstract>
intuitive of modelers, lose the view of the system, and be error -><abstract>
prone. We propose a framework that models cluster computing -><abstract>
evaluates system availability by transforming the UML -><affiliation>
availability model into corresponding analytical models. The -><affiliation>
UML-based availability modeling framework is to bridge the gap -><affiliation>
between the two communities. With our approach, the availability -><affiliation>
analysis of cluster computing systems can be done at the design -><abstract>
stage with ease. -><abstract>
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK -><abstract>
The need for early system evaluation demands standardized and -><abstract>
well-defined design methods and languages. Varieties of software -><abstract>
packages exist to facilitate the availability modeling and specify -><affiliation>
the models in compact forms [10]. On the other hand, the Unified -><abstract>
Modeling Language (UML) is a widely-adopted modeling -><abstract>
