1 Problem and Motivation -><date>
We dene scientic data as multidimensional data obtained either -><abstract>
from the real world or from a simulation. Two characteristics which -><abstract>
are important for our research are that this data is large in size and -><abstract>
the retrieval is often volumetric, meaning that data retrieval is -><abstract>
done by querying a sub-volume of data. [4]. -><abstract>
Today’s scientic data are measured in terabytes. The sensors used -><abstract>
to acquire this data are becoming more and more sophisticated; -><abstract>
therefore, the size of the data that we need to process is likely to -><abstract>
keep increasing. -><abstract>
In the past fteen years there was a thousand-fold increase in pro- -><abstract>
cessor speed, and even a greater increase in memory and hard-disk -><abstract>
size [1, 2]. However, the average seek time of hard disk drives have -><abstract>
improved only marginally in the same time period. If this trend con- -><abstract>
tinues in the future, hard disk seek time will lag even further behind. -><abstract>
This fact negatively affects the speed of scientic data retrieval. -><abstract>
A le system uses a general method (le system cache) to reduce -><abstract>
