1. PROBLEMS AND MOTIVATION -><abstract>
The Semantic Web [2] is a vision of a new generation of the -><abstract>
WWW that will enable computational agents to process data that -><abstract>
have well-defined formal semantics. Agents can use reasoning to -><abstract>
infer new information from statements located on different Web -><abstract>
sites. Just like the current WWW, the Semantic Web makes no -><abstract>
attempt to centralize publishing, effectively allowing anyone to -><abstract>
publish any statement. Thus judging reliability of information -><abstract>
becomes a practical requirement. -><abstract>
As a model example, consider an archive of publicly available -><abstract>
resources updated by a community of knowledge workers (e. g., a -><abstract>
preprint archive of scientific papers). Indexing information in a -><abstract>
digital archive requires extensive metadata schema, enabling -><abstract>
accurate categorization for navigation and search. Such metadata -><abstract>
system would include concepts organized in taxonomic hierarchy, -><abstract>
thesaurus or more complex knowledge structure utilizing ontology -><abstract>
semantics. -><abstract>
One obstacle for utilizing ontology schemas for large and/or -><abstract>
evolving archives, such as digital repositories of research papers, -><abstract>
is defining such an ontology of concepts as to satisfy the needs of -><abstract>
the majority of users who might have conflicting perspectives to -><abstract>
overlapping areas of inquiry. Ideally, metadata created should -><abstract>
reflect perspectives of different groups while spanning all the -><abstract>
content, recognizing links between alternative conceptualizations. -><abstract>
At the same time the system should maximize the quality of the -><abstract>
ontology. -><abstract>
It is our position that this task is best left to the evolving -><abstract>
