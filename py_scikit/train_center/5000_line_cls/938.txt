New domains are emerging that impose new require- -><abstract>
ments for teamwork, where current teamwork infras- -><abstract>
tructure is inadequate. One such large class of applica- -><abstract>
tion require extreme teams, which are large teams that -><abstract>
need (soft) real-time response given dynamic tasks, -><abstract>
and where many resource limited agents have similar -><abstract>
functionality, but possibly varied capability. For in- -><abstract>
stance, when responding to a disaster, ﬁre ﬁghters and -><abstract>
paramedics comprise an extreme team as they must re- -><abstract>
spond rapidly to dynamic tasks; and ﬁre ﬁghters can -><abstract>
all extinguish ﬁres although their capability to extin- -><abstract>
guish a particular ﬁre quickly will depend on their ini- -><abstract>
tial distance from that ﬁre. -><abstract>
This paper focuses on the critical challenge of role al- -><abstract>
location in extreme teams. In general, role allocation is -><abstract>
problem of assigning roles to agents so as to maximize -><abstract>
overall team utility[5]. Extreme teams emphasize key -><abstract>
additional requirements in role allocation: (i) rapid role -><abstract>
allocation as domain dynamics may cause tasks to dis- -><abstract>
appear; (ii) agents may perform one or more roles, but -><abstract>
within resource limits; (iii) many agents can fulﬁll the -><abstract>
same role; (iv) inter-role constraints may be present. -><abstract>
This role allocation challenge in extreme teams will be -><abstract>
referred to as E-GAP, as it subsumes the generalized -><abstract>
assignment problem (GAP), which is NP-complete[4]. -><abstract>
This paper focuses on Distributed Constraint Opti- -><abstract>
mization (DCOP)[2] for role allocation, as DCOP oﬀers -><abstract>
the key advantages of distributedness and a rich repre- -><abstract>
