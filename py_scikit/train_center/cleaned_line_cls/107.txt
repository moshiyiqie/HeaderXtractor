ciseness can manifest itself in for instance the require- -><abstract>

eliminate the impreciseness by information that can not be -><abstract>
justified , it is better to model the impreciseness since it is -><abstract>
the most accurate description that is available at the cur- -><affiliation>
rent point in time. In this paper we present an approach, -><abstract>
which allows the explicit specification of quality estima- -><abstract>
tions and quality requirements including the imprecise -><abstract>
nature. In this approach the impreciseness is modeled and -><abstract>
addressed using representations from probability theory -><abstract>
