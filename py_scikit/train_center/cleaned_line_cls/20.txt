Branch prediction -><abstract>
“Increasing the Instruction Fetch Rate via Multiple Branch -><abstract>
Prediction and a Branch Address Cache”was the first paper -><abstract>
to propose a highly accurate hardware mechanism for pre- -><abstract>
dicting and fetching multiple non-contiguous basic blocks -><abstract>
using leading-edge aggressive branch predictors of the time. -><abstract>
Prior to this paper, the methods to increase fetch bandwidth -><abstract>
relied on software and compiler mechanisms to increase the -><abstract>
size of the basic blocks themselves. The publication of our -><abstract>
paper inspired an explosion of research to further improve -><abstract>
the accuracy of multiple branch prediction, reduce complex- -><abstract>
ity of fetching multiple basic blocks, or increase the fetch -><abstract>
bandwidth in other ways. -><abstract>
