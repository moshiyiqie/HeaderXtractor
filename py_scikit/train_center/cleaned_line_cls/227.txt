1. TRUST ON ELECTRONIC MARKETS -><abstract>
Electronic commerce and trading of information goods signif- -><abstract>
icantly impact the role of intermediaries: consumers can bypass -><abstract>
intermediating agents by forming direct links to producers. One -><abstract>
reason that traditional intermediaries can still make a profit, is that -><abstract>
they have more knowledge of the market, so trading via an inter- -><abstract>
mediary saves on search costs [1], allowing the intermediary to -><abstract>
charge a markup and make a profit. Another reason is trust and -><abstract>
loyalty between consumers and intermediaries (cf. [6]). In this pa- -><abstract>
per we investigate whether trust-based intermediating agents will -><abstract>
also be able to make a profit in electronic markets, where other -><abstract>
advantages of intermediaries (i.e., advantages of location or scale) -><abstract>
disappear, but where trust and reputation mechanisms are becom- -><abstract>
ing popular for helping consumers make purchasing decisions in -><abstract>
the face of information overload on the world wide web [2]. We -><abstract>
model an electronic market where agents trade an information good -><abstract>
over a network. Buyer-agents use a decentralized reputation-based -><abstract>
trust mechanism [4] to determine which connections to maintain -><abstract>
to sellers of the good (producers and intermediaries), communicat- -><abstract>
ing with each other to establish trustworthiness of sellers to which -><abstract>
they are not currently connected. The existence of such a reputa- -><abstract>
tion mechanism allows intermediating agents to accumulate a base -><abstract>
