Multiagent Learning (MAL) is significantly complicated relative -><abstract>
to Machine Learning (ML) by the fact that multiple learners render -><abstract>
each other’s environments non-stationary. While ML focuses on -><abstract>
learning a fixed target function, MAL deals with learning a “mov- -><abstract>
ing target function”. In contrast to classical Reinforcement Learn- -><abstract>
ing, MAL deals with an extra level of uncertainty in the form of -><abstract>
the behaviors of the other learners in the domain. Existing learning -><abstract>
methods provide guarantees about the performance of the learners -><abstract>
only in the limit since a learner approaches its desired behavior -><abstract>
asymptotically. There is little insight into how well or how poorly -><abstract>
an on-line learner can perform while it is learning. This is the core -><abstract>
problem studied in this thesis, resulting in the following contribu- -><abstract>
tions. -><abstract>
First, it sets up a novel mix of goals for a new MAL algorithm -><abstract>
that will achieve some basic learning objectives without knowing -><abstract>
the type of the other agents, such as (1) learn the best response be- -><abstract>
havior when other agents in the domain are (eventually) stationary -><abstract>
and (2) jointly converge on a mutual equilibrium behavior in case -><abstract>
the other agents are using the same learning algorithm, and will -><abstract>
also ensure that in case the other agents are neither of the above -><abstract>
