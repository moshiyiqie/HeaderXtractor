1. Origins -><web>
Modulo Scheduling is an approach to scheduling loops where -><abstract>
successive iterations of a given loop are initiated at a constant rate -><abstract>
using the same instruction schedule for each iteration. This -><abstract>
scheduling approach was inspired by work on designing hardware -><abstract>
pipelines that maximizes the throughput of a single function -><abstract>
pipeline. In this earlier work, the resource pattern of the single -><abstract>
pipeline was optimized; namely, when given enough buffers, -><abstract>
stages could be delayed, so as to achieve an optimal -><abstract>
throughput[1]. This work formalized the resource optimization -><abstract>
problem using reservation tables, which had one row per resource -><abstract>
and one column per time unit modulo the period of the initiation -><abstract>
