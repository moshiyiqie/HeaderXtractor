<note> This informal technical report describes the latest version of the Cassowary algorithm. It is derived from the paper "Solving Linear Arithmetic Constraints for User Interface Applications" by Alan Borning, Kim Marriott, Peter Stuckey, and Yi Xiao [7], published in the UIST'97 Proceedings. The UIST paper also contains a description of QOCA, a closely related solver that finds least-squares solutions to linear constraints. This technical report, which is intended to be self-contained, includes material on Cassowary from the UIST paper, plus a description of the Java, C++, and Smalltalk implementations and their interfaces. along with additional details, corrections, and clarifications. An earlier technical report also discussed QOCA and the similarities between Cassowary and that algorithm [6].  </note>::line_number::8
