<abstract>  Abstract. A formula for the error in Chung-Yao interpolation announced earlier is proved (by induction). In the process, a bivariate divided difference identity of independent interest is proved. Also, an inductive proof of an error formula for polynomial interpolation by tensor-products is given. The main tool is a (convenient notation for a) multi-variate divided difference.  </abstract>
